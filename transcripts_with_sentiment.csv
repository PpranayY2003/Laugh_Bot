kenny,"You guys are the positive audience. Okay? There’s a positive audience that comes out and supports live comedy. It’s great. You could’ve done anything. You could’ve watched Netflix or whatever. Fought traffic. Came late, also. But, it’s okay .You came. It’s nice.

There’s always a negative to this, right? You guys are supporting comedy, there’s a negative audience which hates comedy, dude. Like they hate it. Not dislike. They hate jokes, okay? They will be sitting at home and they see a joke on YouTube and they’ll be like… And they get up and their wife is like, “What happened? – I’m angry. Where’re you going? – I’m going to the police station. Why? -To file an FIR. Are you insane? – Yes. And they go. They wear their slippers and all. And they go to the police station.

Cop! Cop is like, “What?” I want to file an FIR – Of course I’ll do this. I’ll file an FIR for a joke. Other important shit, I won’t do. Yeah. Come. Even the pen is angry. The pen is also… I’ve lost my phone five times and I didn’t file an FIR because I’m lazy. Okay? But, these guys don’t like a joke and they file an FIR.

It’s amazing. I’ve lot of respect for that. Because angry and delusional people are so productive, dude. They’re so productive. It’s not fair. All the smart people are like. But, I’ve to click this for the rainforests. If I click this, the rainforest will get saved? But, I don’t want to click because I want to click on suggested videos. Anyway. So, there’s that audience.

There’s negative audience. You guys are the positive audience.

There’s one that’s worse, third category. Which is, the audience that gives feedback Holy shit. I would take an FIR over feedback. Any day I’m kidding. I don’t want both. Okay? Every time I upload a video on YouTube I upload it and you get the usual comments. Right? You get the haha, very funny. LOL haha. Relatable af. One guy’s like, “You’re only getting fans because you’re cute, buddy.” I’m like, “Yeah. I know I know.”
I know. All these comments. Thanks. All these comments, great expected but there’s this one guy who’ll always like “I love the jokes and observations. They’re very clever.” Ha ha ha But, the real question I want to ask is, “Are you aware of the massive following you have?” Young people look up to you. So, my question to you, Kenneth Sebastian is when are you going to talk about issues? The real issues. Socio political issues. Religious issues. Political issues. Shh shh shh shh shh. Shh shh issues? Space shh shh enter. Okay?

So then I realize that people don’t realize that I’m self aware, okay? I know why I do jokes about restaurants and tea. Okay? It’s not by accident. It’s not like I get up in the morning. Hey, filter coffee is weird this. That’s not why I write. Because whenever I’ve done jokes about tea I make jokes about biscuits. You’ve seen my videos. I do jokes on biscuits. Yes. Ah, see all the love I’m getting. This is lovely.

I’ve never done a joke on biscuits and suddenly I can hear a knock on my door. And suddenly a Parle G biscuit is like, “What did you say, you dog?” That’s never happened because biscuits are non violent. I’ve never seen brutality of two like Parle G brutally murdered by Bourbon. It’s never happened. Okay? That’s why I do jokes on simple stuff that won’t get me in trouble.

People ask me, “Why don’t you do jokes on religion?” Really? Because I’m not insane. Yeah. Because we’re not ready for jokes on religion. I’m sorry, guys. I know you guys think you’re damn cool and open and all. But, no, buddy. You’re not. You’re not ready. Yeah, maybe 60 years from now. When I’m old and I’m in one like open mic and I’ll be like you, “You know, one day, Jesus walks into a bar.” See, all of you have become quiet. Okay? All of you. It’s a hypothetical situation. And all of you become. Half of you are not even Christians. But, you’re like I should be quiet. And it’s a stupid joke. Jesus doesn’t walk into a bar. He can turn water into wine. He doesn’t have to what anyway. So, you guys are not ready, okay? So, religion is out.

Why don’t I do jokes on politics? Because our government is super chill. Yay! Yay! Yay! Super chill, our government is. Our government is so bipolar, it’s not even funny. If I dated someone like the government, I would break up on the first day. Our government is insane, okay? Like rapes are happening. People are getting murdered and shit. Journalists are getting shot in the head. The government is like… Suddenly Padmavati releases somewhere. It’s like. What the Oh oh… The government is a film buff. Okay. That’s the problem.

Why I don’t do jokes on politics is because I am scared. That’s why. That’s why. It’s not like I can’t get punchlines on political jokes. It’s because I don’t want to get punched on my face. That’s why. Okay? And you’re like, “Kenny, you’re scared? Really, bro?” You’re scared? You’re protected. You’re in Mumbai. You’re the one per cent, you know Privileged class. How can you be scared? No, I feel scared. It’s sad.

When you’re in a democracy and you feel scared. It’s sad, you know. You don’t believe me, right? Okay. Go to a movie theater and don’t stand for the National Anthem. Oh shit got real! When you stand up and that fear the goosebumps come, that’s called fear, buddy. Forget that. That’s too ballsy. Just think about not standing for the National Anthem. And from the popcorn, one rifle will come out like this. Sorry Opposition Party. Hello. That’s called fear. Okay? So, I feel scared. Okay? And that’s another problem I told you, right?

People who are very angry and corrupt have the best employees. They’re so productive. Politicians are so productive, dude. They love like people who work for politicians are so awesome. They love their job. How many people love their job here? Not many. All goons love their job. Goons love their job. They’re like, “Sir, who do we have to kill?” “Who do we have to kill, sir?” They’re just… Their hand itches. Goons are damn productive, dude.

Like bank employees hate their job. Okay. There’s no bank employee who’s like today ten home loans, bro. Bank employees are the only people who hate you for coming into the bank. I don’t understand. I don’t. Dude, I don’t want to be. Nobody wants to be there. You enter a bank, like, “Excu – They’re like, “What do you want?” Like they test you. If you’re in the right place. The bank employee is like, “Are you sure you have a bank account here? You’re sure?” You’re sure? This is the home branch. You’re sure? If it’s not the home branch, I will freaking slap you. What is this? Why do you? That’s why I like ATMs. They’e sweet. Bank employees hate their job. Goons love their jobs.

And rightfully so, okay? Goons are super nice and productive. They’re over productive, actually. Like sometimes, they’ll do more than what’s required. Like, “Boss, we didn’t know who to kill. We killed the whole family.” Sir, on the way there was a bus. The bus didn’t let us overtake. We burned the bus also, sir. Sir, practice. We had to practice.

And goons are so health conscious. All goons are fit. And they’re buff! They’re huge. Chest and biceps. Chest and biceps. Chest and Biceps. And I don’t know why they wear such tight t-shirts .I don’t know. All goons will go to the store “I’ll have that shirt.” Like, “Sir, what’s your size? 45?” – No, no, no 12. Tight t-shirts. They want their shirt to be scared of them. Yeah yeah. Remember who owns you. Like their bicep is craving for help.

Okay. Sorry. Sorry. They’re damn productive, dude. Goons I like them. And also, they’re happy. They’re happy employees. Because they get paid on time. Yeah. Goons get paid on the same day. You know any freelancers here? Yeah. See you laughed. You know what I’m going to say. There are freelancers who haven’t been paid since a year and they’re still chasing. Hello, sir. Please give, sir. Sir, please. I did wedding photography for you. Baby has also come out, sir. Please. They don’t give. They don’t pay on time. Goons on the same day. You give the dead body, you get the cash. On the same day, buddy. Throw the body like that. Throw the body like that. At the same time, you’ll get cash. And they play catch, dude. With the cash.

They’ll open the bag and like, “Hey” Chintu, – Yes, sir. This is for you – Oh sir, thank you. Hey, isn’t it your sister’s wedding? – Yes, sir. How do you know? Hey, I care about my employees. Here another – 2 lakhs, sir. What?They play catch. It’s a big “fuck you” to teachers. Teachers don’t get paid enough. They don’t get paid enough at all in any part of our country. Teachers, when they go to the principal, they’re like, “Can we get some benefits?” Students hate us. You hate us. Parents hate us. Can we get some benefits? Principal says, “Yeah.” Two months summer holiday, you also get. How sad is that.

Goons are damn nice. There’s no goon who’s ever raised an invoice. Yeah. There’s no goon like, “Sir, can I get your email ID. I’ve been asking since that time.” October was village burning. November was city burning. December was country burning. So can I please maintain a record of my corruption. It’s organised crime, sir. For a reason. It’s nice. That’s when I realized that I’m performing for the wrong audience. You guys are nice and all. Okay.

But, the thing is, you guys ask for jokes and all. But, when I go jail, none of you fuckers will come. It’s okay. It’s okay. Keep asking. Do jokes on Modi. Fuck you. When I go to jail, you be like, “Anyway he’s not that funny. Leave it.” If you come to jail with me, nicely we’ll do jokes. It’s the worst part.

That comedian is in jail. The joke was not that funny also. I don’t see the Really, dude. He’s in jail. For a joke. That’s when I realized wrong audience! I want to be number one goon comedian. Number one. Okay? Because if Imagine this entire auditorium is filled with goons, okay? Full chest everywhere. There’s chest. Like if I do a stage dive, I’ll bounce back. Chest. When they fart, protein smells comes out. Yeah. So much protein they have. It’s the best. And I’ll do goon jokes.

Like, goon relatable jokes only. I’ll be like, “Don’t you hate it when you put chloroform and they get up half way when you’re beating them up?” Damn embarrassing, dude. Bro, if they don’t stand up for the National Anthem, we’ll break their legs. Bro, if you break their legs, how will they stand up for the National Anthem? Goon comedy. So, yes.

So, in closing, that’s why I don’t do jokes on politics. Because I like my family. I don’t want them to burn them. I don’t want them to be crispy. Medium rare is fine.",guys positive audience okay positive audience comes supports live comedy great done anything watched netflix whatever fought traffic came late also okay came nice always negative

urooj,"Are you guys aware of the cameras? Are you feeling conscious of the cameras by any chance? Because they can’t see you. They are for me. If you all are like, ""Oh, I won’t laugh too much at this joke"" THEY ARE FOR ME. You think I did this for you? This is for the cameras. Are there people here who go to therapy? Anyone? You can raise your hands because I can see some of you. Okay, not bad, not bad. What about the rest of you? Aap sab raat ko ro ke so jaate ho?

(You guys cry yourselves to sleep at night?) It’s free. Therapy is quite expensive, right? Yeah, it’s just more economical to be sad. Can’t be sad and poor. No, you have to choose. I can afford therapy now, and my friends still can’t, okay, because they’re poor. So I keep telling them how great therapy is, and they feel really bad. So they are always just like, ""Can you ask our questions also?"" So now I got therapy for a whole group. Yeah, there are 20 of us. Main sabka sawaal leke jaati hoon.

(I take everybody’s questions to therapy.) But the thing is, I can’t tell my therapist that I’m asking somebody else’s question. So I pretend like they’re all mine. Yeah, yeah, yeah. First, I ask my questions, of course. My questions are very basic, you know. They’re questions like: Why am I sad? Why am I anxious? Why are my friends so poor? Then I’ll be like, ""Listen, hypothetically, if I had a porn addiction, what would you say I should do?"" And my therapist is like, ""You don’t have to say hypothetically. This is a safe space."" I was like, ""Okay... I have a porn addiction."" My therapist was very serious about having a porn addiction, okay. In case anyone has here, I won’t ask you to raise your hands for this just letting you know, she said: It’s graphic. It’s unrealistic. It’s bad for you. She said instead, you have to: Use your imagination. Spend alone time with yourself. You have to touch yourself. I was like, ""Woh sab toh theek hai,"" (Okay, all of this is fine), ""but ab yeh mujhe Varun ko batana padega.""

(But now I have to tell this to Varun.) I went to Varun, and I was like, ""She said, ‘Touch yourself.’ But not right now."" Another friend of mine her question was She’s been in a relationship for 10 years now. A long time, right? And so, she’s no longer interested in sex. She wanted me to ask my therapist why. So I went to my therapist, I asked her my questions: Why am I sad? Why am I anxious? Why am I friends with Varun? Then I said, ""Listen, by the way, I’m not interested in sex anymore."" She was like, ""What, you?! Start watching porn again."" So I went to my friend, and I was like, ""She said you need to start speaking to Varun. You might wanna borrow his hard drive. He has some classics in there."" Another friend of mine, her question was, and before I tell you the question, I just want you to know that I’m not judging her lifestyle choices. It’s just a question I have to ask, okay? She has slept with everyone she knows, and she wants me to ask my therapist... why. and she wants me to ask my therapist... why. So I went to my therapist, and I said, ""I have slept with everyone."" She said, ""Urooj, you have multiple personality disorder."" It’s the only thing that explains this. It’s pretty great going to therapy, though. Therapists always blame everything on your childhood, and that’s my favorite part. Yeah, because that means it’s all your parents’ fault, right? You’re free now. I’ve decided when I have children, though, I’ll send them to therapy immediately. Aaj issue hua kal solve ho gaya.

(You have an issue today, you solve it tomorrow.) Aise bees saal baad stand-up comedy nahi kar rahe hai.

(They’re not doing stand-up comedy 20 years later.) Basement main. (In a basement.) It’s just better, you know. I have a niece (only for the joke). She’s four years old, my sister’s daughter. (only for the joke.) So I told my sister we should start sending her to therapy now. My sister agreed. We have the same parents. She was like, ""Done."" But my niece was coming back from therapy sessions, and she was saying things like, ""Mumma, I’m so happy. I love you. I have nothing to say in therapy."" Awww. So we started beating her. (It’s okay, she’s fictional.) (My sister isn’t married yet.) Now she goes twice a week. It’s value for money. Sometimes when she doesn’t have her own questions, I send her with my friends’ questions. She’s like, ""I’m addicted to porn."" The therapist is like, ""This family is full of perverts. It’s a genetic issue."" It’s nice, though. It’s good to go to therapy. A lot of people go to therapy. Clearly, I go to therapy. You guys go to therapy. My therapist goes to therapy. My therapist’s therapist also goes to therapy. Yeah. But my therapist’s therapist’s therapist... she does drugs. Everyone has some way of coping. I don’t judge. It’s fine. Comedy audiences usually does not go to therapy, right? Because who else would show up at 7 p.m. on a Sunday, sit here with their arms crossed, and just be like: ""Hasa do humein."" (Make us laugh.) ""Help us. Kal Monday hai."" (Tomorrow is Monday.) ""Please...."" You just want to do something with your Sunday. It’s a comedy audience. It’s great. I’m glad you guys don’t go to therapy, and I get to have a career. I appreciate it. I learned a lot from therapy. I really did. But I also have formal education. No, no, yeah. I have a BA in psychology. Wow, no matter how long you wait, no one ever applauds that. No, it’s totally fine. No, no. No, Now it’s condescending. I don’t want it now. It’s fine, I know it’s not impressive because I’m in Bangalore and you’re all probably engineers and doctors. Right? Are you an engineer, sir? ""No, I’m a doctor."" You’re a doctor! Of course, you are. I’m an engineer. Yeah, I get it. You guys are really nice, though. You’re still smiling at me. I really appreciate it. Yeah, because I was doing this show in Mumbai, and there were only five people there. And it was going very badly. And while leaving, there was an uncle in the audience, and he said to me, ""You should study further.’’ It still comes back to me. Sometimes, when the joke doesn’t work, I can hear him whispering in the background: ""Study further...."" ‘’I’m looking into it.’’ I actually did want to study further. Yeah, I wanted to be a doctor because those were the two options when you’re younger. Your parents are like, ""Be a doctor. Be an engineer."" They said the same thing. I said I’ll be a doctor. But I realized I can’t be a doctor because I am... dumb. Yeah, I’m very dumb. And do you really want a dumb doctor? No. Because you people... die, right? It’s really high stakes. So I was like, okay, I can’t do this. So then I saw on Indian television, 8th standard, I saw that I could be a psychiatrist. Yes, because they would show them on TV that they are doctors for crazy people. Pagalon ke doctor hai woh. (Doctors for crazy people.) And I was like, Yeh toh main kar sakti hoon. (This, I can do.) Because if you’re a real doctor, people die. It’s very high stakes. But if you’re a doctor for crazy people, what’s the worst that can happen? Somebody is like, ""You’re a bad doctor."" You’re like, ""You are pagal."" (You’re crazy.) Who’s going to believe YOU? I thought this I can do. But then I went to study it. First day, first lecture, my professor said, ""You can’t call them that."" That was my main reason! But then I started reading about the different mental health diseases, and I was like, ""Yes, I was wrong. We should not call them that."" I also have this. Whoa, my dad has this one. oh god my nani! her photo was there. She is an example? I was like, okay, okay, I should not call them that. Of course, I studied psychology. I did my BA, and I was not smart enough to be a psychiatrist either. So, no offense to them also. So now I do this. But because I started studying psychology, I realized I need therapy. That’s how slow I am. The reason it didn’t work out, I also took a couple of tries to find the right therapist. And the reason it didn’t work out with my first therapist is completely my fault. It’s because I went to a man to talk about my feelings. You’re not convinced? I went to an Indian man. a 60-year-old Indian man. To talk about my feelings. Uhhh, it was not a good idea. In general, I think men do have a hard time talking about their feelings, especially to each other. They never express. They just grab the nearest girl and say, ""Mujhe kuch feel ho raha hai."" (I’m having a feeling.) ""Bhaiyya mujhe bas Bandra jaana tha.""

(Sir, I just wanted to go to Bandra.) Please. But it’s not just that he was a man, okay? I don’t want to alienate the boys. It’s also that he was much older, right? So I was 21 back then, and he was 60. There was a huge age gap. He was an uncle. No, but I don’t mean uncle rudely. I mean... I love uncles. No, it’s not sexual! No, no, it’s not. I’m not ageist. So it’s not like ""Ewww, uncle,"" but it’s also not like ""Oooo, uncle."" It’s neutral. It’s normal. Uncle. And back then, when I was 21, my main issue was that I did not trust men. So I went and told him that. I said, ""I don’t trust men, especially in relationships."" And he said, ""You shouldn’t."" I said, ""I have a boyfriend."" He said, ""Very bad."" I said, ""I think he’s going to cheat on me."" He said, ""He will."" I said, “Why will you say that?” He said, ‘’Because men have needs.’’ Yeah. So I started crying. I was like, ""Uncle, please. Uncle, stop."" Yeah, I realized that was not a good idea. So I looked for another therapist, and I really liked this one, like when I found her. Because when I told her, ""I don’t trust men,"" she said, ""Why stop there? Don’t trust women either."" That is solid advice. I have a few issues. I’ll tell you about them. You’re stuck in this basement. Where will you go? One of my issues is that, I genuinely have a very hard time criticizing people, especially family and friends. It’s very hard for me to give them negative feedback. And I told my therapist this. And she said that the reason I have a hard time criticizing them is not because I’m a nice person or like I’m too sweet. She said it’s because I don’t want to hear anything about myself. I was like, ""Bitch, I’ve been nothing but nice to you. Why would you say that to me?"" Then I started crying. I love crying. I cry all the time, dude. I love crying so much. I was crying backstage. That’s backstage. I was crying on my way here. I’ll cry on stage if you guys don’t laugh. Why did you stop? I cry on flights. Babies complain about me on a flight. ""Why is she crying?"" I cry so much. Anyone I’ve ever dated has given me the same feedback. They’re all like, ""Urooj, it’s very hard to argue with you because tu rone lag jaati hai."" (You start crying.) I was like, ""It’s working! Yehi toh trick hai."" (This is the trick.) If I may ask the front row, Sir, when was the last time you cried? ""Don’t remember."" Don’t remember? Okay, if you had to narrow it down, maybe in units, is it like days, weeks, months, or years? ""A year."" A year? Full year? Wow. Okay. He doesn’t cry. Doesn’t laugh that much either. It’s not bad. I appreciate the effort. Sir, what about you? When was the last time you cried ""Two years ago."" Two years back? Wow Did something happen? ""It was just at the airport."" It was at the airport? Oh, were you saying goodbye to someone? A lover? ""I was the one traveling."" You were the one traveling? How selfish! No, no, it counts. Two years ago is fine. Okay, one year ago. I’ve noticed a pattern wherever I go. I ask this question to men and women, and men always have bigger gaps between their cries. It’s something we all know, it’s not new. Men obviously don’t cry as much. This is still impressive, though. Usually, I get answers like Five years ago. Ten years ago. When I was born. And I really feel bad because I think it’s our fault. That boys don’t feel comfortable to cry. As a society, we don’t make it a conducive environment As a society, we don’t make it a conducive environment for them, So they don’t. And it has side effects—for everybody. A lot more men have heart attacks because they suppress their feelings A lot more men become alcoholics glug glug glug it’s how they express themselves. And a lot more men are serial killers. I looked this up. Yeah, there aren’t enough female serial killers. We are really underrepresented. And I think that’s what the next wave of feminism should be about more female serial killers. But I think the worst thing that happens when men aren’t allowed to cry and boys. I really do feel bad about this one. is that they start podcasts. Every time I open Instagram, there are two boys with a microphone, going like: ""How to be alpha male?!"" Just cry, baby boy! Just cry. Just have one cry. You’ll feel better. Crying too much, is also not good. That’s what I do. Crying too much is also not good. Because I cry so much I’ve never won an argument. What do you need to win an argument? Logic. Points. Presence of mind. What do I bring to the table? Please... Never won. So I went to my therapist. I asked, ""Can you teach me how to win?"" And she said, ""Urooj, you don’t win arguments. It’s all about arriving at a solution together, mutually."" So I said, ""Paise wapas kardo."" (Give me my money back.) But she gave me one tip. She said, ""If you find yourself in an argument, use the ‘I’ language instead of the ‘you’ language."" Yeah, you can use this. It’s when you say things like : ""I feel..."" ""I believe..."" Don’t say things like: ""You suck."" Makes sense, right? I shouldn’t say things like: ""You’re a bitch."" I should say: ""I think you’re a bitch."" She’s like, ""You’re being stupid."" I said, ‘’no I think.’’ Abhi sikhaya aapne. (You just taught me that.) I’ve replaced ‘you’ with ‘I’ everywhere. Thank you is now ""Thank I."" Fuck you is now ""Fuck I."" It gets very confusing during an argument. Someone says, ""Fuck you,"" and you’re like, ""Fuck I.’’ ""Yeah, main bhi yahi bol raha tha.""

(Yeah, I was saying the same thing.) Okay, argument over. Urooj is now ‘’Irooj’’ now. I’ve been quite thorough. I’ve changed everything.",guys aware cameras feeling conscious cameras chance see like oh laugh much joke think cameras people go therapy anyone raise hands see okay bad bad rest aap sab raat ko ro ke

varun,"Are you ready?

Are you excited?

So put your hands together

and welcome on stage

Mr. Varun Thakur!

Good evening ladies and gentlemen.

How are you guys doing?

Good evening, my name is Varun Thakur.

As you may have figured by now,

I am a stand-up comedian.

But sometimes I feel

like a prostitute.

I'll tell you why.

The other day I get a phone call,

I answer the phone.

The person at the other day,

he's like...

""Hi Varun, what's your rate?""

I'm like, ""Sir, I think you are looking

for a different kind of stand-up.""

He still doesn't get it. He's like...

""Hey Varun, what's your rate? How

much you do and how long you do for?""

By that point I've given up.

I'm like...

""You want to know with

or without the happy ending?""

But I don't blame him, right?

Because being a comedian is not really

as popular a profession just yet.

Even people my age

get confused.

My friend Pooja, made me meet her

friend Tina

my friend Pooja.

Made me meet her friend Tina,

she's like...

""Tina, this is Varun,

he is a comedian.""

So even Tina looks.

And I was like, ""Hi?""

And then they both walk away.

And I can hear Tina tell Pooja...

""He wasn't that funny.""

I'm like I said hi.

What you want me to do?

Dance around?

Like even my parents, the first time

they came up to me and they said...

""What do you want to do in life?""

So I said I want to be a comedian.

So even they looked at me.

""All that is okay,

but what do you want to do in life?""

But nowadays they are

a lot more supportive,

my dad comes home and says...

""Hey! I have a joke for you.""

I'm like, ""Yes dad, tell me.""

So he takes out his phone and...

""Where is WhatsApp?

Here do this.""

And I'm like, ""Dad, that's a WhatsApp

joke. I can't do that on stage.""

And he's like,

""You do it in your own way, no.""

Because Indian parents don't give

a fuck about Intellectual Property.

""Ah! You do it, do it.""

Then I realised that's what

Anu Malik's parents told him.

Dad, dad! Arabic song.

""The building is tall.""

You know, not just our parents.

Even people who organise comedy shows

aren't really in tune

with how comedy works.

So I was doing this show in Delhi.

I reached the place,

the event guy calls me up.

He's like,

""Sir, you had a good flight?""

I said, ""Yes.""

""You're tucked in

nicely in the hotel?""

I said, ""Yes.""

""Sir, just want to ask you one thing.

Will you need a mic?""

That's literally

the only thing I need.

I'm like,

""No, actually I don't need a mic.

You know what?

I don't even need an audience.

You just put a chair there,

I'll come and start blabbering.""

I was in Goa day before yesterday.

And I am performing at an auditorium,

I am in the green room, I go to the loo

and I find out that the hand wash isn't

there and there's no paper napkins.

So I go to the guy

who runs the auditorium...

""Sir, there's no hand wash

and paper napkins in the toilet.""

So he looks at me and

very seriously says...

""Yeah, so?

It's Sunday today.""

I'm like,

""Don't people take a dump on Sundays?

What do you mean it's a Sunday?""

For the longest time, every time my

parent's friends ask them you know...

""What does Varun do?""

They couldn't really say.

So my dad would say,

""Something creative.""

I don't know why this

is the symbol of creativity.

I'm like, ""Dad!

This doesn't mean I'm creative.

This means I am ACP Pradyuman

from CID.""

But I am half Sindhi,

half Maharashtrian.

Which means I am full of billion

business ideas but too lazy to execute.

Why are you clapping

because Maharashtrians are lazy?

Here's the thing.

I come from a middle class background.

Any middle class people in the house?

Make some noise.

Of course,

always happy, always excited.

Yeah!

You know how you know

someone is middle class?

They'll tell you.

Over and over again.

No, no. We don't do this.

We are middle class.

No, we are middle class.

We don't do this.

Middle class people love two things.

They love displaying their

modesty and their underwear.

Standard.

Before you go to a middle

class person's house,

you already know what

colour underwear they wear.

We have this weird

affinity towards plastic.

We love plastic.

We want to cover

everything up in plastic.

Especially our remotes.

I got my new TV five years ago.

My remote still has plastic.

And it's not like we put new plastic

every year, it's the same plastic.

The gum from the cello tape has

dried and it's hanging like that.

But we still use it.

I asked my dad.

I'm like...

""Dad listen. Why do we still have

this plastic cover on the remote?""

This is what he told me.

""Son, the reason it is like this

is because when people come to our house,

they need to see we

keep our stuff properly.""

I'm like, ""Who are these people?

Who are coming to your house

and judging you by

how you keep your remote.""

""We had gone to the Thakur's.

The house is okay but the remote...""

You know there is optimum utilisation of

resources in middle class households.

Optimum utilisation of resources.

The other day I was brushing

and then the toothpaste is over.

So I told my dad,

""Dad, the toothpaste is over.""

He's like, ""What? Give it to me.

You can't even use it properly.""

I'm like, ""Use it properly?

I've used it.""

""Give it.""

Then he did something called

'The Middle Class Squeeze.'

You guys know

The Middle Class Squeeze?

Where you take the

paste and then you turn it.

And then you press it.

And throw it on the ground and...

If it still doesn't work,

""Hey, get the tractor quickly.""

Even when we use our shampoos right,

you guys when you come

to the end of the shampoo,

what do you guys do?

""Fuck this.""

We don't do that.

We're like, ""Give me water.""

Even when we buy a car,

we buy everything

that comes with the car.

You know,

the detachable stereo system.

The tissue paper with Britney Spears'

face on it for some reason.

That Ganpati up-top

and the Ambi Pur bottle.

That's the most important thing.

The Ambi Pur bottle.

Till it gets over.

And you realise the

new bottle cost 500 bucks.

So this empty bottle just

sits there in front of the AC.

Even when we shop for clothes,

we'll always shop in a sale.

Always.

You go shop in the sale,

the older brother wears it.

When he is done,

he gives it to the younger brother.

Once he is done wearing it,

it becomes one of three things.

It becomes a rag, a night suit

or your watchman will wear it.

Go to my building right now,

you'll see a 35 year old Bihari

guy wearing a T-shirt that says,

'Fuck me. I am famous.'

Don't ask me why I had that T-shirt.

And if it doesn't become one of these

things, it becomes clothes for Holi.

""Son, don't throw this.

Wear this during Holi.""

I have a cupboard

full of Holi clothes.

I have 35 options of

clothes to wear on a day

where nobody gives a

fuck about what I'm wearing.

You know, but we are

not happy with what we get.

Once you pay some amount of money,

you will always want more.

Middle class people always want more.

You get the sandwich,

""Add some chutney. Add some more.

A little more.""

This is their go to response.

""Please add some more.""

Because the other person is like...

""Fuck man. Take this.""

You know middle class

people treat their kids

like they treat their electronics.

If it's not working, hit it hard.

I've never given

my electronics for repair.

My dad just takes it

and hits it really hard

and it starts working amazingly.

They do the same thing

with their kids.

Like when I was younger,

my mom would run around the house

hit me with anything

that was one arm distance away.

Anything.

Belt, rolling pin.

One day she threw

a potato cutlet at me.

And I was like, wait.

Should I irritate her more so that

she throws chutney and bread also?

But dads don't do that.

Dads don't do that.

Dad will just sit in the chair,

look at you and say...

""Hey, come here.

You come here.

I am not running after you.

I will hit you here.""

My parents were

really supportive.

You know they've

supported everything I do.

Even when I was younger they would

push me to do a lot of things.

Especially fancy dress.

Did people here take part

in fancy dress, make some noise!

It's fucking amazing.

I love fancy dress and my mom

was really serious about fancy dress.

You all have to do fancy dress...

She was like very competitive,

you know.

In our school, we had a rule.

If one place plays a character,

another person can't do that. Right?

So in my first fancy dress competition,

I wanted to dress up as Gandhi.

And then I remembered,

why do they call it fancy dress?

I'm dressed up as Gandhi,

which is the least fancy...

a dress can get.

Right?

But there was another kid.

Even he wanted to be Gandhi.

So we were both fighting.

""I will become Gandhi, I will

become Gandhi. I will become Gandhi.""

Then our mothers were

very competitive, got involved.

""No, my son will become Gandhi.

My son will become Gandhi.

My son will become Gandhi.""

Eventually I got to play the part.

But I was really scared,

I was hoping the other mother doesn't

dress her son up like Nathuram Godse.

""Aunty please don't do that.

It'll be very wrong, very wrong.

Don't do that, please.""

So I got to be Gandhi, right?

And I had my full dress on.

I had the dhoti, I had the glasses,

I had the bald cap.

But as I was going up,

the bald cap slipped.

So all the hair in the

front just stood up like that.

So now I have a spike cut.

And I go up on stage,

so basically I was Gandhi

if he was in Dil Chahta Hai.

The second year my mom said...

""You know what we'll

mix it up a little bit.

This time, I am going to

dress you up as a drug addict.""

Hold on, let me explain.

She was like,

""You know what I am going to do?

I am going to give you a straw.

The straw will have powder in it,

you go up on stage

you blow the powder out,

powder goes up.

You cough *coughs*!

Drugs are bad, don't do drugs.""

I'm like sure.

I am 9 years old, I don't give a shit.

So the day happens and

I am waiting in the aisle,

about to go up,

the teacher's on stage

announcing the other guy out

she's like,

""Rohan, that was a very good peacock.

Up next, we have Varun and he is a...

Good peacock, no?

Up next is Varun and he is a...

drug addict.""

And I just walked in

on stage sauntering like that

because that's how

I think drug addicts are.

I've gone in and I've

just blown up! *coughs*

Drugs are bad, don't do drugs.

I came first.

You know, now I realise my mom

made Udta Punjab 20 years ago.

And in the final year of fancy dress,

my mom said...

""You know what? This year you're going

to be something out of this world.""

I'm like, ""Really? What?""

She's like,

""You're going to be Miss World.""

I'm like, ""Sure.

I am 10. I don't give a shit.""

And so I was wearing my cousin

sister's halter dress, off shoulder?

Whatever the fuck that is called.

You know the gloves in my

hand and the tiara and the sash.

And here's how middle

class my parents are.

Even in a hypothetical competition

where they could

dress me up as anything.

They dressed me up as Miss World.

Not Miss Universe.

So I asked my mom.

""Mom! Why can't I be Miss Universe?""

She looked and me and she was like...

""Son, have you seen your face!""

You guys agree that we have

the worst ads on Indian TV, yes?

Make some noise if you

think they are the worst ads.

I think they are getting

worse by the day, right?

The other day was watching

TV and I saw an ad for bottled water.

Manikchand Oxyrich.

Because when I think of clean, pure

drinking water, I think of Manikchand.

It's called Manikchand Oxyrich.

And the tagline is,

""Now with more oxygen.""

Here is a scientific

joke for you, guys.

Chemical composition of water is H2O.

Two atoms of hydrogen,

one atom of oxygen.

More oxygen makes it H2O2.

Which is hydrogen peroxide

which will kill you.

But it's Manikchand.

So it probably is hydrogen peroxide.

Then there was an ad

for a phone company, okay?

I forget which one it is.

And the USP of that phone

is that it's two-way answer phone.

Because you know sometimes

when you answer the phone

you answer it the other way round.

But now don't worry, because

Samsung has a new phone for you guys.

Seriously.

How lazy are these fuckers?

That you had to dedicate an entire

Research & Development

team on doing this.

See, who are these people?

You call them and they'll be like...

""Hello!""

""Yeah, say!""

""Bro, I can't hear you.""

""Because I am holding

the phone the other way round.""

I'm like, ""So hold it properly.""

""No, it's too much work.

I think I need a new phone.""

Every ad on TV is technology, right?

No matter what the product is.

""This has technology.""

Like two letters and

technology after that.

""This has technology.

Wow, we will have to buy it.""

And I was in Pune and I

heard this ad on radio, right?

The ad was...

""A-1 mosquito repellent,

now with Mosquito-Go-Away technology.""

Guys, they've stopped giving a fuck.

They're like, ""Write anything. Write

technology, these morons will buy it.""

Mosquito-Go-Away technology?

Could lesser fucks be

given in naming technology?

It's like he made this technology

and then went to his two year old niece...

""Sweetie, what should I name this?""

""Uncle, what happens with this?""

""Mosquitoes go away.""

""Mosquito-Go-Away technology.""

Then you have ads for face wash.

Like a face wash is

not a face wash anymore.

Face wash is anti-darkening,

anti-pimple,

anti-wrinkle,

anti-twinkle, anti-this, anti-sweat.

A new Garnier face

wash is anti-pollution.

I was like, what?

We are killing it in

science and technology.

We are removing pollution

with our face wash.

I'm like why are poor people in

Delhi following the Odd and Even rule.

They should just be putting

face wash in their exhaust pipe.

Even ads for creams.

When you watch any ad for creams,

what does it say?

""This contains vitamin A,

B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J...""

There's more vitamins

in my cream than my breakfast.

And that ad would always end with...

""Vitamin blah blah.

And essential minerals.""

I'm like if the minerals are

so essential, tell me what they are.

Why are you hiding it?

Did you watch any ad for deodorants?

What does it say?

Spray this deodorant,

chicks will have sex with you.

But there is this new deodorant.

New Fogg deodorant.

They changed their USP.

They're like,

""Now, with guaranteed 800 sprays.""

All the Gujjus are like, ""Wow!

What a deal!

800 sprays in 80 rupees?

Amazing!""

No seriously.

Now with guaranteed 800 sprays?

So every time I spray a deodorant, I

have to maintain a fucking excel sheet.

""Kshh kssh! Monday, 2 sprays.""

""Kshh kssh! Wednesday 5 sprays.""

""Kssh! Saturday I'm meeting

a girl so I'll use the whole bottle.""

But there was an ad

a couple of years back.

I don't know how many of you

guys saw. There was an ad--

(distinct laughter)

Wow! Someone's getting the joke now.

There was an ad, there was an ad

a couple of years ago for rat poison.

I don't know if you guys saw that.

And the tagline for that was...

""Rats will eat this inside your

house, then die outside.""

You guys remember that, right?

Tell me one thing.

Are rats that obedient?

And this one rat comes home,

he's eating it.

Suddenly he starts gagging.

Another rat is like, ""Hey Prakash!

What are you doing?

Go outside and die.

Haven't you seen the ad?

Get out.

Get out.

Get out.""

But these are ads on TV.

I'll tell you the worst kind of ads.

Please tell me you

guys watch Teleshopping.

(audience cheers)

It's my midnight entertainment.

Just watch Teleshopping.

The minute you are sad,

tired, depressed in life,

just watch that.

And bless yourself that

you don't have to do that.

Because I have been called

to audition for Telebrands.

I am not even kidding you.

I've been called to

audition for Telebrands.

I was watching it the other day,

I was watching Telebrands.

Any ad for Telebrands

begins like this.

You have a white dude

that just says one thing,

""I used to be very fat.""

It makes no difference

what the product is.

This is a roti maker.

""I used to be very fat.""

""I used to be very fat.""

So the ad that I was

watching the other day,

they were selling

low calorie toothpaste.

Who the fuck is eating toothpaste?

And why?

Can you imagine the ad for that?

""I used to be very fat.

I used to eat all my toothpaste.

While brushing in the morning,

I'd have lunch, breakfast,

dinner all at once.

I used to be an idiot.

But now I use this toothpaste

from Telebrands

and I'm an even bigger idiot now.""

(distinct laughter)

Wow!

We have a hyena in the crowd.

So that's one kind

of Teleshopping ads.

But there is another kind.

It's called Gold Safe.

Has anyone here watched Gold Safe?

I'll tell you for those of you

who don't know Gold Safe is this show

where they show you pictures

of two celebrities put together.

I was 100 percent sure.

50 percent of you

guys have called it also.

Fuck you guys.

I'm sure.

So the Gold Safe is a show

where a picture of

two celebrities are put together.

You know using state-of-the-art

technology like...

Microsoft Paint.

I was watching it the other night,

they had a picture of Sachin Tendulkar

and Kareena Kapoor put together.

Sachin's face is round.

Kareena's face is long.

Their resultant picture

looked like an ice-cream cone.

Because they don't give a fuck.

They're like, ""Add anything.

Nobody will know.""

And then you have this amazing

host who comes up and she says...

""Hello!

You are watching Gold Safe.

If you call now and

guess who are these celebs,

you will get a chance

to win 50 thousand rupees.

Just imagine, what all can

you buy with 50 thousand rupees.

You can buy a car, an AC,

TV, fridge, you can go out

for dinners, you can party too.

In 50 thousand rupees. Come on!

Call now and guess

who are these celebs.""

Compared to her,

Shankar Mahadevan's Breathless

sounds like a fucking lullaby.

I don't know who this chick's cocaine

dealer is but I want her number.

And she is really bad.

She's really bad.

Her entire career

is a bad audition tape.

""Come on, call now and

guess who are these people.""

Then the best thing happens.

Because all the callers call in.

Right?

And these fuckers never get it right.

Okay, so one caller comes in...

""Our first caller.

Come on guess. Who are they?""

""Madam, Sunny Deol and Lara Dutta.""

I'm like a blind goat

can get that answer right.

Then other guy calls up...

""Our second caller.

Guess who these celebs are?""

""Madam, Arjun Rampal

and Kangana Ranaut.""

I'm like you called Sachin Tendulkar,

Arjun Rampal?

Sachin's great with a piece of willow.

Arjun Rampal is the piece of willow.

So maybe.

But still.

And then she realises

no one is getting it right.

Because like 80 people

called and nobody gets it right.

So then she's like...

I can see what you're doing.""

And suddenly you're like, ""Oh shit!""

She's like,

""I can see what you're doing.

I am here just for you. Just for you.

I am here so that you

can win 50 thousand rupees.

50 thousand.

I'll give you hints

if you want to win. Hints.

Check this guy out.

Anjali Tendulkar.""

I'm like really?

That's your hint for Sachin Tendulkar?

Anjali Tendulkar?

And then she's like,

""Check this girl out.

She is not a Ash.

She is not a Sonam.

She is not a Bipasha.

She is not a Katrina.

Her name starts with

K- and ends with -areena Kapoor.

Guess who is she.""

Even then some dickhead

calls up and he's like...

""Oh madam, Sanjay Kapoor!""

Then nowadays they've

started selling viagra...

on Teleshopping.

Have you guys seen that?

Power Prash!

Power Prash!

And they make it seem so legitimate.

You know they have one dude

who is wearing a dhoti and a kurta.

He signifies the

Ayurvedic side of things.

Then next to him is a guy in a suit

who signifies the scientific

side of things.

And then you have Kashmira Shah,

who signifies tits.

And she looks to the

camera and she's like...

""Nowadays a lot of couples

go through a lot of physical problems.

And now let's hear

Manoj and Payal's story

who are facing the

same physical problem.""

And then you cut to a recreation

of Manoj and Payal's life.

Where Manoj is just standing

like that and Payal is just...

And Manoj is like...

""Payal, what happens

to you every morning?""

And Payal looks at him and goes...

""Me? What happens to you every night?""

Ohh!

That's cold.

And Manoj has no comeback right there.

He's like...

And then Payal just goes on and on.

She's like, after marriage have you

even pleasured me?

Those beautiful memories,

those colourful nights.

Those sweet talks.

Those wet dreams.""

Here's the thing.

In this entire ad, for viagra they

don't mention the word sex even once.

They only speak in

these weird euphemisms.

And he's like...

""Payal, but I am trying!""

""Trying? You just keep trying then.

Here are the divorce papers.""

I was like one second.

Why are you roaming

around with divorce papers?

Even divorce lawyers

don't have it handy.

How the fuck do you have it handy?

And she pulled it

out of her Salwar Kameez.

I'm like how the fuck does

the Salwar Kameez have a back pocket?

It's baffling.

And she get's pissed

and she throws and runs away.

And walks out.

And Manoj is like, ""Payal!""

You know because this signifies loss.

And he turns around.

As he turns around, his friend

is behind him.

Who is in a full suit and a tie,

ready to go to work.

And he turns around and he's like...

""Hey! Ravi!""

And Ravi is standing there, okay?

Two things wrong with that.

First thing...

for Ravi to be behind him, he'll

have to have been inside the house.

And he's like, ""What happened Manoj?""

Manoj says,

""I don't know what to say, Ravi.""

""If you won't tell me, then

who else will you tell this to?""

He's like, ""Forget it.""

And walks away.

Walks away, goes to a window.

And just stands in the window.

Because this signifies sadness.

And then Ravi comes from behind.

And as the reassuring hand

of the friend on the shoulder.

You know like...

Like that.

He's like, ""Hey Manoj.

I am your friend.

Tell me what happened.""

And he turns around and again now,

he doesn't say the word sex.

He just says,

""I don't know how to say this, man.

After marriage I haven't been

able to pleasure Payal.

Those colourful memories,

those sweet talks,

Those colourful memories.""

And this is Ravi's response.

""That's it? Such a small problem!""

Here's the thing, Ravi.

If your friend has

an erectile dysfunction,

saying such a small problem...

is not the right thing to say.

And Manoj is like,

""That's not a small problem!""

He's like, ""This is nothing.

Here, use Power Prash.""

Why the fuck is this

guy ready to go to work

with a packet of Power Prash in his...

It's like this dude wakes up

every morning, he's like,

""Lot of my friends can't get it up.""

So I should be a good guy.

And just drop off a pill

At everyone with erectile dysfunction.

Seriously.

This entire ad, is about two people who

have something in their back pocket.

And one person who has

nothing in his front pocket.

But I didn't always

wanted to be a comedian.

I actually wanted to

study filmmaking, you know.

I went abroad to study filmmaking.

I was in London for a year.

Where I spent the first six months trying

to get them to pronounce my name right.

Because they are like, ""Vroon!

Vroon!""

I'm like dude,

just call me Tom, it's okay.

And I spent the next six months

trying to explain to them

what are plastic cups doing in my toilet.

That's always an awkward

conversation right?

All my white friends

would come home and say...

""Vroon! Why is there a

plastic cup in your bathroom?""

""The thing is when I pee,

I get really thirsty so

I'd like to have a glass handy.""

Do you guys like the British accent?

You guys like the British accent?

Sounds very sexy, sounds very cool.

My first proper exposure to

British accent, I walk into school

and this guy is looking at me.

He looks at me...

""Mate can you pass me

the bo-uhl of wa-uh.""

He's like,

""Can you pass me the bo-uhl of wa-uh.?""

I'm like, *gibberish*

One word, English.

Sounds like?

And this guy is pissed off.

This guy is pissed off.

He's like,

""Can you pass me the bo-uhl of wa-uh?""

I'm like bottle of water?

I don't get it.

The British people made the language.

Use all the words.

""No, no. We've invented the language.

We'll omit a few words.

Go fuck yourself!

Now interpret it yourself.

We're not going to spane food.

Spane food?

Spoon feed.

Fuck.

You know the student

hostel I stayed at right?

We decided to have a potluck

and get to know each other.

Now we were all supposed

to cook food from our own country.

I was a really poor student.

I only had a packet of

Poha with me.

Do you all know what Poha is, yes?

So I made Poha and took it for dinner.

I'm like what the fuck

will these caucasians know.

I don't know what the Chinese guy made

but I am pretty sure it wasn't dead.

Because I took a serving

and it started running away from me.

I'm like, ""Hey! Shut the gate.

My dinner is trying to escape.""

The French girl made the *gibberish*

Because that's what

the French people do, right?

Make you eat shit you can't pronounce.

*gibberish*

I'm like, ""Hey! Same to you.""

The Afghan kid kept looking up hoping

for a NATO helicopter to drop something.

He's like, ""Hey! Food please! Food.""

But I wasn't any better.

I only had a plate of Poha with me.

And this white girl walks up to me.

She's like, ""Vroon!

What have you made?""

""These are flattened rice flakes with

robust Indian spices with assorted onion

and dash of lime and sprinkle

of coriander and basil leaves.""

Fuck yeah!

I went Master Chef Andheri on it.

I'm like, ""Here, have some Poha.""

But saying that stuff helps right?

A dash of lime.

Sprinkle of coriander.

Basil leaves.

Basil leaves are like

the push up bras for food.

They don't do shit but

they make your food look great.

So you know when I was in the UK,

they launched the Bandra-Worli

Sea-link so I was fucking excited.

I went to all my friends, I'm like...

""Guys, check out.

There's a sea-link in my city.

There's a sea-link in my city.""

But no one's excited.

Because my flatmates were German,

American and Chinese.

""Hey fuck off. Get lost!""

""We have 30 thousand fuck off.""

I was excited and I had

to share it with someone.

So I was like, ""Hey Bangladeshi.

No, no! I won't hit you.

You come here.

Come here!

Slippers,

leave your slippers outside.""

The Pakistani guy got really excited.

He's like, ""Hey! Sea-link?

Very good, man!

How many entry points does it have?

5? Okay, okay!

We can go there by boat?

By boat?

Okay! Okay!

Do they have police protection?

Okay...okay!""

But that's the thing

with Pakistanis right?

Half the time they

just pretend to be Indians

and the rest of the

time they'll be like...

""Pakistan...Pakistan!""

Especially during sports.

""Pakistan will win today.

Pakistan will win.""

And I'm like dude, relax.

I know you know the

results of all the games.

But chill.

But he's like,

""Today Pakistan will win.

Today Pakistan will definitely win.""

I'm like, ""How?

England is playing Australia.

How will Pakistan win?""

The first time I

went to London, right?

I was in the cab,

I was waiting at a signal

and I see this old Englishman walk.

And he is wearing a jeans,

T-shirt, keds.

Suddenly he walks to my car,

knocks on the window and starts begging.

I'm like,

""There's beggars in London as well?""

""Can you put some change?""

I'm like, ""Hey, buddy listen.

I come from India.

Okay?

I'm so desensitised to beggars,

you have no idea.

The last guy who begged

from me didn't have an arm.

You have to up your game.

Seriously.

You are dressed better than I am.

You speak better English.

Do something at least.

Tear your clothes.

Sing a little.

Something?""

""Hey give me some change.""

""Hey give me some change.""

You know white people

get really excited

when they find out

that you're from India.

""Oh my God!

You're from India?

I love India.

I really want to go to India.""

I'm like, ""Why?""

And they'll all say this one thing.

""To find myself.

I want to find myself.

Yoga and...

...ashram""

I'm like, ""You go to Marol.

You'll never find yourself.""

And it was this girl's

birthday, right?

It was this girl's birthday.

She's Greek, she called us all over.

She was like,

""Guys, you know what would be awesome?

Is if you all sang Happy Birthday

to me in your own language.""

Great, because the

American guy is like...

""Happy Birthday to you.""

And the Chinese guy is like...

""Fu fu!""

Whatever.

I'm not being racist.

Every country has the

same tune for happy birthday.

Now they're all looking at me.

And I'm just standing there

like a constipated Udit Narayan going...

""May this day come again and again.

My heart sings again and again.

May you live a thousand years,

I pray.

Happy Birthday to you.""

Why couldn't we have the

same tune for Happy Birthday?

Where is Pritam when you need him?

Alright guys, that's been my time.

You've been absolutely fantastic.

Thank you so much.

Welcome on the stage,

struggling actor...

Vicky Malhotra!

Yes hi friends Vicky this side.

And yosulf?

Very very fantastic.

Good to be here.

Hi baby! Is that your brother?

Bro, don't leave her alone like this.

Yes hi guys.

I know most of you all know mahsulf.

But if you all don't then

probably you are living under a rock

or Koparkhairne or whatever.

Because both places

don't have Snapchat.

But for all you loserz

who don't know mahsulf.

I have to tell you stuff about me.

If there are any

directors in the crowd

or whatever or they want to make

a biopic on me or whatever.

So you'll know everything.

Okay!

So here's the thing about me.

I'm a guy.

And mah profiles are...

Thank you.

My chest is 38 inches,

biceps 22 inches,

penis 11 inches.

And when I am not horny it's 10 inches.

Mah hobbies are living,

chilling, killing, raging,

dancing, internet and pilates.

Mah best friend is Sunny.

He's an actor.

Tommy, he's an actor.

Juggy, he's an actor.

Lovey, he's an actor.

Monty, he's an actor.

And Sanket...

he's a physicist.

But we don't talk to him much

because he's a very pretty lame guy.

Since school he's been

so lame like he likes reading.

Who the fuck likes reading?

Who the fuck likes reading?

And that idiot would

sit and learn trigonometry.

I'm like bro, you're never going to

use trigonometry in real life.

Never.

Like where will you go?

You go to buy vegetables.

""Sir, give me some tomatoes.

What is the tan theta for this?

Tan theta?""

You don't do that.

You don't do that.

But I am also a reader.

I am also a reader.

There is this amazing

book that I read you know.

It helps me calm, chillax, relax.

It's for good for me time.

You must've heard of it.

It's called Playboy.

Once I pick the book up,

I just can't keep it down.

Get it?

Bro, you know what the joke is right?

Because I have an erection,

I can't keep it down.

That's the joke.

Mah favourite sun sign is Scorpion.

And...

(audience cheers)

And I am an Aries.

Mah favourite song is Summer of '639.

It's fucking amazing.

Like Summer of '639.

I don't know what 639 is.

I think it's a band name,

school roll number whatever.

But it's fantastic.

I love it.

I love it.

Very pretty fantastic that is.

Mah favourite non-veg

food is butter chicken.

And mah favourite veg

food is also butter chicken.

Because veg food sucks.

And I think vegans should

just stab themselves with a carrot.

Like seriously.

What the fuck are these vegans?

They're so annoying.

Like I'll tell you

why I get irritated okay.

Like the other day, I went

on a date with this slutty chick.

And...

We went for the date

and so I called for mah food.

You know I called for butter chicken,

chicken tikka masala,

butter naan, chicken naan, garlic naan

and edamame sushi.

And I told her, ""Yosulf

can call for whatever you want.""

And she's like, ""Vicky!

I'm very pretty sorry.

But I'm a vegan.""

I'm like, ""Oh my God.

Oh my God.

Yosulf is a vegan?

What are you going to tell me next?

You have herpes?""

But anyway she had

nice tits so I stayed.

And then she called for her food.

She called for organic,

non gluten, non dairy,

non tasty, legume only salad.

Basically she called

for air in a bowl.

Then we called for the bill and

mah bill was 600 and her bill is 1200.

1200?

I'm like how does your food have half

the ingredients and is twice the price?

But she has nice tits, so I paid.

No, but I told the slutty vegan chick,

I told her, ""Listen.

Your dinner might be vegan

but your dessert is at my house

and it's non-vegan.""

Yea, I've never spoken

to her after that but fuck it.

You know but like see,

I'm a sexist guy.

I'm a sexist guy.

I am telling you straight up,

I'm a sexist guy.

Alright?

My friends are like...

""Dude, you can't tell that in public.""

I'm like, ""Fuck you.

I can tell whatever I want.""

And what's wrong with sexist?

Like person who likes

lyrics is a lyricist.

Person who like cycle is a cyclist.

I like sex.

So I'm a sexist.

Or fuckist or doggy stylist.

Whatever you want to call me.

Whatever.

You know, mah favourite

holiday destination is Ibiza.

I love Ibiza because

for a rager like mahself

Ibiza is like Vaishnodevi.

I'm like, oh Ibiza Ibiza!

It's very pretty fantastic.

It's always parties

and all everywhere.

Like you go for a pre-party,

then you go for a party.

Then you go for the after party,

then you go for a post party.

Then you go for the after post party.

And then you go for

the morning rave party.

And then you come

back from the post party

which is the pre-party

of the after party.

And then party party,

another party and then another party.

And after 19 days,

it'll be party party party!

It's very pretty relaxing.

It's very pretty relaxing.

You know all hot people

come and ask me like...

""Bro, why do want to be a comedian?""

To these people I say, ""Fuck you.""

I can be whatever I want.

You know what I mean?

See, here's the thing.

I'm trying an alternative

way to get to Bollywood.

You know, I am a very alternate

kind of guy. Alternate.

Oh alternate.

Oh alternative.

Oh alternate guy.

Have you seen me walking?

Oh fuck he's so alternate.

Fuck!

Like that!

It's so very pretty simple like see

Vir Das became comedian became actor.

Himesh Reshammiya became

singer became actor.

Tusshar Kapoor became

Jeetendra's son became actor.

So basically it's mah dad's fault.

Okay, all my dad had to do was become

an actor and I would become an actor.

But no, my dad became a businessman.

He could be anything.

He could be a producer, director,

music director, spot boy, whatever.

I would become an actor.

But no.

He want to be a businessman.

Yea, mah dad is a businessman.

Mah mother is a mom.

And...

Like...

No really, she's a mom.

She's a mom. What do you know?

She's a mom.

My mother is a mom.

And then you know people

keep asking me like,

""What kind of

businessman is your dad?""

I'm like, I don't give a flying fuck.

As long as I get 10 lakh rupees a month

for ma living, chillin,

raging, I don't care.

I don't care if he's a businessman

or a bar dancer, cocaine dealer.

Whatever.

Infact, I don't even

know my dad's first name.

His name on my phone is 1204 Malhotra.

1204 is his ATM pin.

Let me have mah protein shake.

Protein is very pretty important.

So anyway I told my dad,

""Dad listen why doesn't yosulf

be like other guy's dad.

Why can't you produce

a movie for mahsulf?

Just give me 50 crore

and produce a movie for mahsulf.

Like Hrithik's dad did it.

In 2000. 2003, 2007, 2009, 2016.

Why isn't yosulf doing it?""

He's like, ""Okay fine son.

Here is 50 crores.""

I'm like, Kewl?

I got it.

But the problem is that none of these

actresses want to act with mahsulf.

And they're all giving me

lame reasons like...

""Oh, we are not okay

with topless scenes.

We are not okay with

bottom less scene.

We're not okay with frontal nudity,

backal nudity, lip lock, item number.""

I'm like yea, good luck in Bollywood.

Seriously like mah surname

is Malhotra...

not Barjatya.

So if any of yosulfs is a sexy

actress and wants to act in mah movie

Sex, Love or Something Else,

let me know.

Very pretty hit movie.

When it comes out.

Sex, Love or Something Else.

It is always something else.

You know the other day

I called my dad and told him...

""Dad listen, for my surprise

b'day gift, I want a BMW.

I just told him straight away,

for my surprise b'day gift,

you have to give me a BMW.""

You know what my dad did?

He gave me an Audi.

Fuck.

I'm like, ""Dad,

if you don't love me, just tell me.

What are you giving me

this Audi for?

Shee!""

Like he's done this in the past also.

Like when I was young, I told mah dad.

I said, ""Dad listen! I want a dog.

I want a Doberman.""

You know what my dad did?

He got me a pomerrrrrian.

What the fuck?

Pomerrrrrian?

I don't want a pomerrrrrian.

Very pretty annoying.

Anyways he was a cute dog.

You know and I didn't

want to give him any cliched names

like Tommy or Tuffy or whatever.

So I called him Scooby.

And you know they say that

the dog behaves like it's owner.

So obviously mah dog

was very pretty horny.

Because one day he was fucking air.

Like he was fucking air.

He was just fucking air like that.

You know we were all

sitting at home eating dinner

or whatever and the doors open,

this fucker ran away.

He ran away.

My dad and I running after him,

we go to the neighbouring lane.

Now he's become friends

with these group of dogs.

All chilling or whatever.

And then another gang of dogs come

and they are about to fight

like Eagle gang, Scorpion gang.

I'm like, ""Scooby, come here.

Don't do Saila-ru Saila-re.

Come here.""

Confusing.

He's like, ""Saila-ru, saila-re!""

I'm like what?

What are you doing?

Seriously.

So we went to get him

and he ran away from us.

He ran away and mahsulf

and my dad are running after him

and then I could hear a car screech.

And then I heard a sound...

""Awwoo Awwoo Awoo!""

I'm like oh mah God!

Scooby's come under a car.

So when I went and checked.

I'm like oh thank God,

it's not Scooby.

And then I just went ahead

you know to the neighbouring lane.

What? It's not my dog.

I'm not going to pick him up.

So I went to this

neighbouring lane okay

and in mah neighbouring

lane there's a temple.

And outside the temple

there is a fat bitch.

What?

A female dog is also called a bitch.

I don't call women bitches.

Unless they want me to,

then I do.

But anyway,

so this fat bitch is a big dog!

A big big bitch sitting

outside the temple.

Because every person eats half the

sweet and gives her the rest.

So this fat bitch

has now become a cow.

And she's just sitting

outside the temple like that.

But now I am looking,

behind this fat cow who is that?

It's Scooby.

Scooby is behind the

cow and he's just like...

He was doggy styling.

Or as he likes to call it,

styling or whatever.

He's does that and mah dad is like...

""Oh mah God, this is Scooby.

Scooby don't!

Scooby don't! Scooby don't!""

I'm like, ""Dad, it's not Scooby Don't.

It's Scooby Do.

Scooby Do.

Scooby Do.

Do it more.""

And my dad is very pretty annoying.

He doesn't even want to

let Scooby have sex in peace.

He's like,

""Scooby don't! Scooby don't!""

And you know what Scooby does?

He's fucking like that okay?

And he turns around.

""What is it?

What's yosulf's problem?

Do I come to yosulf's room

when yousulf is having sex?

Get out.""

I've been living in Bombay

for like 3 years, you know.

I stay in a very pretty small,

4BHK in LW.

Lokhandwala.

But it is very pretty small.

Only 10 lakh rupees a month.

It's very pretty tough mah life.

Very pretty annoyed.

But one thing I noticed,

the other day right?

I met with an accident.

Because this idiot has

stopped at a red light before me.

I'm driving, he stopped

at red light and I banged into him.

And then he comes out and he's like...

""Bro, you're drunk.""

I'm like, ""Umm, no!

I've had only 8 drinks,

I'm buzzed at best.""

He's like, ""Bro, why is yosulf

not looking on the road and driving?""

I'm like, ""Because I'm texting.

How do I text and look

at the road at the same time?

Bloody idiot.""

I said, ""Were you texting?""

He said, ""No!""

I'm like,

""Yosulf should also look on the road,

yosulf should look at the rear view,

see I am coming fastly

and get out of my way.

You fucking idiot.""

Stopping at a red light.

Loser.

You know who is the most

excited to see an accident?

Those unemployed mofos

on the side of the road.

Have you seen those

guys standing like that?

We fuck up, they are the most excited.

""Boss, what happened?

Boss what happened?

What happened? Tell me.

I'll tell you what happened?

What happened, what happened?""

I'm like,

""How will you tell me, you idiot?

You were scratching

your balls two minutes back.

What you're a lawyer now?""

Seriously there is so much pointless

employment in Bombay,

it's not even funny.

Like the other day I went

to this mall, what is that?

Palldiyum.

I went in and the security guard okay,

he comes and this James Bond

comes and knocks on mah window.

He's like...

""Sir, can you please

open the glove compartment?""

I'm like, ""Why? What do you want to do

see my RC book, insurance papers what?""

He's like, ""No sir.

I want to check if you have a gun.""

So I'm like, ""Come here.

Put your head inside, come here.

This is a glove compartment.

Not a gun compartment.

Nobody keeps their gun

in the glove compartment.

What you think ISIS

has made this whole plan

""Bro, we have a very

pretty fantastic place.

We'll hide there.

Nobody will know.

Yes sir, where?

We can hide it in

the glove compartment.""

So I went to the sea-link

the other day, okay?

And like 20 metres away from the booth,

there's a guy who's job is to do this.

I'm like very pretty thanks, bro!

Because it couldn't call me, I was

just going to drive into the sea.

And then 10 metres away, there's

another guy who's job is like...

""Hey, keep the change ready.

Keep the change ready.""

I'm so very pretty confused.

I'm like do you work

for sea-link or you a beggar?

What are you?

Then you reach the booth

and then you give your money

to the guy outside the booth

who gives it to the

guy inside the booth.

Puts in it and then he gives it

to the guy outside the booth

who gives it to you.

That's 4 peoples.

4 peoples.

And just when you thought it's over,

guess what, it's not.

Because there is another

guy who's job is to do this.

Bloody idiots.

No but like seriously.

People ask me, ""Bro,

why do you want to become an actor?""

I'm like, ""Umm! Bro! I don't want

to become an actor. I am an actor.""

Seriously.

Yeah! Make some fucking noise.

Anyway and becoming an

actor is a very pretty tough job.

You know you have

to do a lot of things.

You know a lot of preparations.

Like what I did.

I joined the gym.

It's very pretty, like I bought

all the latest equipment, you know.

You know wireless headsets,

Nike headband, wrist band,

shock absorbing shoes.

I got Fitbit, whatever.

You know, I have a trainer

who's put me on a

very pretty strict routine.

On Monday I do bicep,

on Tuesday I do back bicep.

On Wednesday I do chest bicep.

Thursday I do shoulder bicep.

On Friday I do bicep bicep.

And you know everybody's like,

""Hey Vicky,

when do you do legs?""

I'm like, ""Umm bro!

I don't need to because I wear jeans.""

You know I keep going

for auditions every time.

And the casting director

sends you text messages

telling you where the audition is,

what to wear,

who to sleep with,

who to not sleep with.

It's very pretty

important information.

So this one day I got a text message,

it said...

""Audition for Redstar batteries.

Must have rockstar look.""

I'm like fuck yeah!

I'm a fucking Bon Jovi

kinda guy anyway.

Check.

And the second part

said must have lean body.

I'm like wow look at this.

I would fuck mahsulf.

Check.

Next part said must be long.

Double check.

And last part said must

be Indian version of Brad Pitt.

So I went.

I'm like why don't you just write

in the message

that you want Vicky Malhotra.

No seriously.

Brad and I have the same jawline like

I would be the one divorcing Angelina.

But herself has not met me

and so it's not happening.

And so I love going for auditions

like the other day

I went for an audition

for pregnancy test.

Yea, so I go for the audition

and the casting director

comes to me and he's like...

""Okay bro,

this is an improvised audition.

In this your wife is going

to tell you she is pregnant

and whatever your reaction is,

is the audition.

I'm like wow! So very pretty easy.

Like I love improvising

because once you date 18 chicks

at the same time,

you have to be good at improvising.

I'm like Kewl.

I'm good, I'm improviser.

Everything.

Bring it on!

He's like, ""Kewl, are you ready?""

I'm like, ""Yes, one second!

Yes ready!""

He said, ""Action!""

I'm like, ""Yes, hi Priya!

Mahsulf Vicky this side and yosulf?

Can you please make butter chicken?""

And then he's like, ""Cut! Cut! Cut!""

I'm like, ""What happened?""

He's like, ""Why is yosulf

asking her for butter chicken?""

I'm like,

""Umm, because I like butter chicken?

And she's my wife.""

He's like, ""Bro! No, no, no!

She's pregnant,

she's telling you she's pregnant,

don't talk to her

about food or whatever.""

I'm like, ""Okay, kewl!""

He's like,

""Are you ready for your next take?""

I said, ""Yes!""

Ready!

Action!

""Yes, hi Priya!

Vicky this side and yosulf?

The food was very pretty

okay but my stomach is hurting

and I've got really

like pain or whatever.""

And again he is saying cut.

I'm like, ""What happened now?""

He's like, ""Why are you

still talking about that?""

I said because she made

fuck all butter chicken.

Her mother has not taught her anything.

She makes fuck all butter chicken.

That's spicy.

Bloody I got acid reflux.

And he's like, ""Bro! Bro! Bro!

You listen it's not about

the food or whatever.

Like you had the butter chicken,

you've gone to the doctor.

You had digestives,

it's five days later...

And like she's telling you

she's pregnant, how will you react?""

I'm like, ""Kewl!""

He's like, ""Cool! Are you ready?""

I said, ""Yes!""

Ready!

Action!

I'm like, ""Yes hi Priya,

masulf Vicky this side and yosulf?

Who's fucking baby is that?""

Again he is saying cut.

He's like, ""Why is yosulf

asking her about who's baby that is.

It doesn't fucking matter

who's baby it is.

It could be my baby...""

I'm like, ""Oh my God!

You motherfucker.

You have been having

sex with my wife?

Behind my back?""

And then even my wife is like,

""No actually, it's not his.""

I'm like, ""Shut up you fucking bitch.

You fucking lied to me?""

I cannot cannot act.

I told them I want to get out

of here because I cannot act in an ad

where my director has

had a kid with my wife.

It's very pretty

uncomfortable for masulf.

And I just left.

But I still love going for auditions.

I still love going for auditions.

You know because very pretty

sexy chicks come for auditions.

Wow!

I love it.

You know nowadays there's a lot of

Brazilian chicks coming to auditions.

And Brazilian chicks are like

Indian chicks with Amaro filter anyway.

No, no! You're pretty. You're pretty.

Okay, but that's a trend right?

Nowadays like all these

chicks come from abroad countries.

And they don't know

how to speak in Hindi.

And they become top actress.

Like Katrina Kaif,

Jacqueline Fernandez, Sunny Leone,

Upen Patel...

They all are very pretty successful.

You know why?

It's because cleavage has no language.

Cleavage has no language.

It's everywhere.

Yes I understand what you say.

You know but I've also been

selected for independent film.

You guys know independent films?

Independent film?

Yea I've been selected for independent

films but it is the worst thing to do.

Because independent films

are independent of money.

They have no money.

All beggars. Poor people.

I went on set and I find out that

my vanity van is a fucking tree shade.

Now I was very pretty hungry.

I went on set you know.

I wanted my high protein

soya and chicken salad,

so I was like,

""Where is the spot boy?""

And suddenly one guy

comes to me and he's like,

""Excuse me sir.

The spot boy is a little busy.

He is taking a shot right now.""

I'm like, ""Oh my God!

The spot boy is also

the cinematographer?""

And he looks at me like, ""Yea, bro!

Everyone's done two-two rolls.

So you are seventh lead

and you are makeup boy.

I'm like, ""Umm! No!

I'm going to be fuck-off-boy.

And you're going

to be suck-mah-dick-boy.

I'm out.""

Then people are like, ""Bro!

You should join theatre

if you want to become an actor.""

I said, ""Umm! No!

You should join theatre

if you want to become poor.""

Like seriously.

I don't want my daily wage

to be 7 rupees and half cup of tea.

Like seriously.

I can't do that.

I've gone to a lot of theatres.

You know I see these guys wearing

Khadi, Kurtas, you know.

Holding that skull in their head.

""To be or not to be!""

I'm like, ""Bro, come!

Let me help you out.

Please don't be a theatre actor.

It's simple.

Because like theatre

is lot like movies,

except nobody is shooting it

and nobody seeing it.

It's a good joke, I know.

No, that's why I just

love like regular movies.

Like my favourite genre

of movie is sex comedy.

I also like sex drama.

Sex thriller, sex action.

Sex period film, oh wait!

That can't happen.

You can't do sex period.

So bro, you know the

joke is what happens...

you can't have sex during periods.

That's the problem.

But you know, I know you

guys are looking at me and thinking

and oh fuck,

he's such a casanova kinda guy.

I know, I know.

I can see it in your eyes.

Like wow!

How is he a casanova player?

But there is a very

other side to mahsulf.

You know, important thing

that I want to talk to you guys.

It's about this gal,

I was in love with.

And she was in love with mahsulf.

Her name was Lovely.

And I was her lovely.

So Lovely and I were having

a very pretty good relationship

till one day she told me

that she is going for office trip.

And that she is going on Saturday

and she's going to come on Monday.

Okay?

So obviously I called

another chick home.

Seriously.

I'm a very gentleman kinda guy, also.

I'm not going to

tell this chick's name.

I will just call her Busty.

So Busty...

I still get dreams

about that sometimes.

You know, so Busty and I were at mah

house and out of nowhere Lovely shows up.

Lovely shows up.

She catches me and she's like,

""I want to break up with yosulf!""

And she broke up with me.

I was so sad.

I was so sorrow.

I was like oh my God.

Yosulf is breaking up with mahsulf?

Like seriously?

I trusted you.

I put mah belief in you,

you know I wanted you,

you wanted me, we wanted love.

Then why did you

cheat on me like that?

Why did you tell me you are coming

on Monday and then come on Sunday?

It's a complete break of trust.

If you've had just kept

your word and come on Monday

and not on Sunday,

we would still be together.

That's why all the gals here,

I just want to tell you all one thing.

Okay?

If tomorrow, you tell your boyfriend

that you are coming on Monday,

then don't come on Sunday.

If you come on Sunday,

then you message him.

And for some reason if

he can't reply to your message

because maybe if he's

handcuffed to a bed?

Don't come to his house.

And if you come to the house

and you come inside,

you'll see another

girl's shoes and her bra,

then don't come to the room.

If you reach outside the

room and you can hear sounds like,

""Oh wow Vicky!

More more, amazing. You're so big!""

Do not open the door.

It's simple physics.

Simple physics.

No but the two weeks,

when Lovely and I were together,

she taught me very

many things about gals.

You know, all you guys, all will

agree with mahsulf when I say this.

When women say that they're fine,

they are not fine.

Then once Lovely was angry and

I asked, ""Listen why are you angry?""

She's like, ""I'm not angry.""

I'm like, ""Okay kewl! Wanna have sex?""

And...

She was like, ""Why will I have

sex with you? I am angry with you.""

I said.

""You said yosulf is not angry.""

She's like,

""You tell me why I am angry?""

I'm like,

""Why is yosulf playing KBC with me?

Like seriously tell me what you feel?

Just tell me what you feel.""

You know ladies tell me...

if tomorrow you're going to eat a

sandwich and you go to the sandwich guy

and you want to eat a chicken sandwich

but you tell the guy mutton sandwich.

And then the guy gives

you mutton sandwich.

Then you can't get pissed off and

say why you giving me mutton sandwich,

I want chicken sandwich.

He'll be like, ""You didn't

tell me you wanted chicken sandwich.""

And then you'll say,

""Can you not tell from my

face that I want chicken sandwich?""

No!

He cannot tell you

because he doesn't know what

a chicken sandwich face looks like.

Seriously.

Like another thing that chicks do na.

They always keep cribbing like gals.

I swear to God.

They are so annoying!

They just look at the cupboard

all the time and they're like,

""Oh my God! I have no clothes.

Oh my God! I have no clothes.""

Her cupboard was full.

It was more stuffy than

Siddhivinayak on Tuesday.

She' s like,

""Oh my God! I don't have any clothes.""

I'm like, ""Lovely! You have eyes.

Your cupboard is full of clothes.

You can dress up half of Africa.""

And then if they are not

worried about their clothes,

they are worried about themselves.

They're like, ""Oh mah God!

Mah hair is not looking good,

mah face is not looking good.

I have cellulite,

mah hips have become big.""

I'm like,

""Listen Lovely, all that is true.

But like telling me again and again

is not going to make it go away.""

Guys, am I right guys?

Like seriously, I can help you out.

Why don't you keep that

cupcake down and go for a jog?

Seriously like you can't talk about

women and not talk about their driving.

Like seriously.

It's fantastic.

The best comedy show ever.

Why is it that everytime

a woman is driving

and it seems like she

is driving for the first time?

Like seriously,

I don't understand this.

Have you seen women parallel park?

Oh my God!

The best way for chicks to

parallel park is to give it to a guy.

It's okay ladies,

I'm a sexist kinda guy.

I told you all first only.

You get what you see.

You get this.

This is sexist.

No seriously,

I don't know what the problem is.

Sexist is amazing.

You know the other thing

that I don't like with chicks,

I don't like watching

movies with chicks.

Oh my God, like seriously.

Like we are watching movie and they'll

be like, ""Oh! What is happening now?

Who dies?

*gibberish*""

I'm like,

""Listen, did you have to interrupt

our make out session to ask me that?

Why yosulf is asking

me about the movie?

My name is Vicky not Wikipedia.""

Like seriously, like.

And you know,

we were watching Interstellar.

She didn't understand Interstellar.

How dumb is this chick?

I'm like Interstellar

is so very pretty easy.

You guys know right?

It's a movie about two astronauts who travel

on a spaceship, who go through a

wormhole to break the space-time

continuum to meet the Lazarus colony

who created the Tesseract

in which Coop goes

and uses gravity

to talk to his daughter

and thus save the human race.

It's very pretty simple.

You know but apart from chicks also,

another thing I

absolutely love is music.

I love music.

I'm a musical kinda guy.

I am very musical.

You know like my favourite

genre of music is EDM.

EDM!

Make some noise if you like EDM.

For all you illiterates who do

not know what EDM is, EDM stands for

Extremely Dance Music.

And then you start dancing like this.

Fuck!

And the best part is

they don't have lyrics.

They don't have lyrics.

It's the most fantastic thing

because lyrics don't make you dance.

Simple.

Like how many times have you

heard a Javed Akhtar lyrics and said,

""Oh, I'll have to dance on it.

Birds, rivers, air...""

No, you don't do that.

We don't do that.

You just need beats.

You just need beats.

It's like...

It's just beats.

Like seriously, if I was not

a very pretty successful actor,

I would be a DJ.

I would be a DJ for sure.

I already have my

DJ career planned out.

You know I've got a black T-shirt,

I got sunglasses.

A laptop.

I can make a heart.

Look at this heart.

It's like it's beating.

And I can say put your hands

up in the air in 14 languages.

Like if you look at people's blood,

you'll see like red blood cells,

white blood cell.

In me you'll see red blood cell,

white blood cell and beats.

Fuck, this guy has beats in his blood.

No seriously.

Most people's heart beats dhak dhak.

You know how my heart beats?

*mimics electronic music beats*

Put your hands up in the air!

You don't have to talk to anybody.

Just slap someone on the face,

kick someone on the balls.

So very pretty amazing.

Beats came out, sorry.

You know most people think that models

and successful actors are dumb.

Let me tell you, we're not!

You know like,

I'm a very pretty political kinda guy.

I am very political.

You know, I am very pretty

amazed with what happened recently.

You know finally President Trump has

become the Prime Minister of America.

After he became the Prime Minister,

I also had like an executive order.

He's like Muslims are

not allowed from 7 countries.

I was like, ""Oh mah God!""

I was so sad, I was so shocked.

I was horrified.

I was like shit, how can you do that?

How can you not have

Pakistan on the list?

Seriously.

But anyway, I am very pretty

happy that President Trump won

and not that bloody Hillary.

Oh my God!

Seriously.

If Hillary would have won,

they would've talked about other stuff

like oh welfare, education, equal rights.

And all peh peh peh!

Boring!

But with Trump America is amazing.

Like Trump has said

you do whatever you want.

You can hit black people,

you can shoot someone,

you can say Muslim fuck off.

Grab pussy, whatever you want.

Whatever you want.

And people keep saying,

""Hey bro listen.

You know Trump does not

have any political experience.""

I'm like, ""Hello! Have you even

become the secretary of your building?

Or class monitor?

No!

Then how can yosulf tell

me what Trump wants to do.

Like fuck that.

And honestly, who does yosulf

want to see as first lady?

You want to see Melania Trump

or that fucking Bill Clinton?

Let me tell you.

Bill Clinton looks fuck all in a gown.

Very pretty fuck all.

I do not want him as the first lady.

But this election gave

me a lot of hope you know.

Because it has shown

to people that in America,

anybody can become Prime Minister.

Anybody.

Anybody.

Which is why I have

decided that in 2020,

Vicky Malhotra will run

for President of America.

And when Vicky becomes

Prime Minister of America,

he's going to make

America great again!

Again!

Thank you guys!

Oh mah God,

I can see your ugly faces.

I'm sure it's been a privilege,

for you guys to see me.

I am sure, you had a wonderful time.

You know all you sexy chicks

if you want to meet me backstage,

take a photo with me,

have sex, whatever.

Just let me know.

But before I go I have

to prove it to my dad

that I am very pretty

successful comedian also.

So you guys have your masks?

Wear the mask.

Alright, everybody.

Where is that cameraman?

Hey idiot!

Are you guys ready?

Alright, at the count of three.

One, two, three!

Mahsulf Vicky this side!

(crowd) And Yosulf

Alright, thank you so much guys.

You've been very pretty fantastic.

I hope you had a good time.

And kindly fuck off

and don't drink and drive.

Actually drink and drive.

Or do whatever the fuck you want.

You've been absolutely fantastic.

virdas1,"I lost 80% of my mind. It’s very freeing. You should see the look on your faces right now, by the way. Oh! Good evening, San Francisco. Are you guys excited, yeah? All right. Well, my name is Vir Das. We’re gonna have such a good time tonight. I’m so excited. It’s gonna be delightful. Oh, this is how I talk now. I just thought it was time to really embrace my roots, you know, and to make my comedy more authentically Indian. And really, what could be more Indian than a fake American accent? I don’t think you understand. I have an opportunity to make history tonight, guys. I can. I can be the first ever Indian who comes to California… and then leaves. That’s never happened before. Because you guys are sticking around. Until they kick you out. Which, going by the news, is about three weeks from now.

Now, I used to work in America in the year 2002. It didn’t go very well, so I left for browner pastures. And then, honestly, I didn’t think about you guys for 15 years. Because, honestly, there is nothing that you can get in America that I can’t get in India. And then my government banned beef and I was like, “You know, an international career might not be such a bad thing!” Make no mistake. I’m just here for the beef. It’s been a good couple of years for me. I went on my first world tour. I saw the entire world. I went… Yeah. Would you like to know what 33 countries in the world have in common? – Would you like to know, yeah? – Yeah! Two things. Number one, I have now masturbated in all 33 of those countries. Thank you. I’m like the Genghis Khan of the Holiday Inn chain. My DNA is everywhere. If your hotel has a memory foam mattress, I’m the memory.

And two, no matter where I went in the entire world, people said the same thing. They said, “Oh, my God, you’re Indian? I love Indian people. They’re, like, so smart. Indian people, you’re, like, so smart.” Which leads me to believe the rest of the world not that smart. Now, there’s no answer to that question. Whenever somebody says, “Indian people, so smart,” all we can do is just, “Namaste,” and, “Yes.” “Okay.” Because we all know the reality, right? In reality, 20% of India is smart. Eighty percent of India is so stupid, we don’t even give them a passport. Eighty percent of India is just Being Human t-shirts and Gaurakshaks, all right? That’s basically India. No, in reality, 20% of India is smart, but it’s a population game, so we get away with it. Because 20% of India is 98% of most countries. So, statistically, Indians are not smarter. There are just more smart Indians. And if you’re taking time with that joke… …you’re in the 80%. And for the world to progress, you need to go. That’s what I believe. If this world is going to progress, Eighty percent of us, this, everything, everyone needs to go. Same number, 80/20, applies to you, American people and English. Think about your country. Eighty percent of America speaks English good. But I’m pretty sure 20% of America speaks English well. And if you don’t understand the difference… then you will make America great again.

I promise you. You’re the one. It’ll happen because of you, you, you. Build that wall. But in today’s world, we don’t need to speak English because we have social media. Eighty percent of social media cannot spell “social” or “media.” And if you can figure out how to communicate with them, you can rule any country in the world. That’s the new strategy. A leader, a brand gives us three, four words of evil. We are instantly hypnotized, mesmerized, on board. That’s all it takes. Three, four words. “Make America great.” “Build that wall.” “Jail that bitch.” “Drain that swamp.” “I’m lovin’ it.” “You’re worth it.” “Liyo to Jio.” “Abki baar Modi sarkar.” We are on board instantly. But… Every day on Twitter I am called anti-national, unpatriotic, a traitor, un-Indian, and to all of that shit, I say, “Spot on!” Because, fun fact, 80% of my nationality is Indian, but I’m 20% African. Yeah. And I know what you’re thinking, “Vir, which 20%?” And I will tell you. It’s my childhood, guys. My childhood.

I grew up in Africa. In Lagos, Nigeria, but see, when I say the word “Africa,” firstly, some musical shit happens in your head, right? The minute I say the word “Africa…” …but then after that… you guys think of, like, tribes or nature or wildlife or malaria. When my parents went to Africa in the early ’80s, when Indians were going to Africa for gold and diamonds and oil and malaria… Malaria has pretty much never left Africa. If Africa is McDonald’s, malaria is French fries. They just give you that shit with everything. I realize I’m being a bit unfair, comparing McDonald’s to malaria. You know, malaria is a curable illness. But… But Indians were very rich in Africa. We had a house with an electric fence around it. All Indians did. At our gate, 24/7, was an armed guard with an AK-47 machine gun. Security. Do you know how many people you would have to murder in India to get that level of security? Oh, sorry, I messed up the joke. Sorry, sorry, sorry. One second, I’ll do it again. Do you know how senior a politician you would have to be in India… And then we lost everything in one week. A dictator got shot, government changed, expats fled, and all of a sudden, we were poor for the first time, but the worst kind of poor, guys. New poor. Yuck. ‘Cause, you know, normal poor, you don’t think twice about that shit. Do you? No, you accept it. I’m poor, you’re poor. We can’t afford downtown. We live in San Jose. You accept that shit, but… But when you’re new poor, you have a fresh reminder of what you’re missing.

Let me give you context. We went from a nine-bedroom house in Lagos, Nigeria, to a seven-bedroom house in Delhi, in Noida. But we only had enough furniture for one bedroom. Do you know what it’s like to live in a house with six empty bedrooms? If you meet somebody in there, you just assume they’re a ghost. I was 16 years old. Do you know how important it is for a boy to have his own room at 16? We are producing our body weight in sperm on a daily basis when we are 16. Indian men, have you ever jacked off in an empty room with no furniture? We need something to rest on, right?\ Just… Structure. You know, in case you think of that one extra girl and the legs go. You know what I’m talking about. I had to train myself to jack off in the center of the room like a yoga guru. Like a feng shui master. Vastu and tathastu in the same orgasm. Really feel out the space. When I was done, I could never find the sperm. The floors were Italian marble. Till date, if I have sex, I face the girl north.

My father is my hero. My father went from driving a Mercedes S-Class, beautiful German engineering, to driving a Maruti 800. Americans, it’s just a roller skate with dreams. But he’s my hero because he never lost his optimism in his adversity. On the day he walked us in to buy that shitty car, he got so excited about that car. He knew it would make his family excited about that car. Fuck, he got the people at Maruti excited about that shitty car for the first time. He walked in performing. “Is this your top-of-the-line model?” “Yes!” “Well, what makes this one top-of-the-line?” “Sir, this one has four wheels. Also, sir, the car has a sun roof.” “Really? I don’t see a sun roof.” “Yes, sir, but the roof is made of tin. So it absorbs so much heat, you feel like you are sitting in the center of the sun. This car has two indicators, sir, left and right. Here’s the right one. And the car has six gear changes.” “Really? I only see four.” “Exactly. There’s first, second… third… …third… …third… and fourth. “Would you like me to turn the air conditioner on, sir?” “Absolutely.”

My mom had to get a job. She had never worked before, so she did the one thing that women who spoke good English in India did. She read the news for Doordarshan. Americans, Doordarshan is like our CNN, but with credibility. With no training or formal experience, my mother was Doordarshan’s top newsreader in one week. That’s all it took. Yeah. That’s how bad Doordarshan’s English was at the time. I don’t know what happened at her first job interview. They’re like, “Mrs. Das, can you pronounce ‘epsinocage’?” “Do you mean ‘espionage’?” “You’re hired, madam! We’ve been wondering for ten years.”

I changed schools. I went from India’s top private boarding school, The Lawrence School, Sanawar… Yeah, yeah, damaged goods. …to… From Lawrence School, Sanawar, to Delhi Public School. Yeah, that was a great transition. I went from an English medium school to a school where they spoke English medium. I went from nouns, pronouns and verbs to chest, shoulder, triceps. I went from Shakespeare, Byron and Keats to, “Eh, madam, eh!” I couldn’t do the examination thing. Here’s how bad my results were in Delhi Public School. My first PTA meeting, the teacher sat my parents down and she was like, “Mr… and Mrs. Das… Vir has issues… that need to be… addressed.” And then I realized she was talking to my parents really slowly. Because I think she just assumed the stupidity ran through my family. And the thing is, I’m not stupid. I’m just dyslexic. You guys know what dyslexia is? It’s a reading-writing disorder. You jumble up letters. When I was in school, that shit didn’t exist. Like, if I went to my parents, “Mom, Dad, I’m dyslexic,” they’d be like, “Shut up, boys are not meant to be with boys.” But… By the way, if you’re dyslexic, being gay is a great choice. Plus, LGBTQ just sounds like a dyslexic kid trying to spell a big word. Something like “lozenges” or… “logarithm.” Like, till date, I can’t write cursive. It’s a big issue in my life. I can’t write joint letters. I remember the first time I told my mom, typical Indian mom, I was like, “Mom, I can’t write joint letters.” And she was like, “Why don’t you write all the letters first and join them later?” “Because I’m writing an essay, Mom, not designing a fucking freeway.” So I had to write all of my exams in block letters, so in my final grade 12 exam, I got 52% in English, even though my answers were good. And I think it’s because the examiner thought I was yelling at him. You know, he’s just reading my paper. “The reincarnations of Krishna represent the true line of Indian mythology!” He’s like, “Well, that’s a good point, but I don’t like your attitude.” Because back then, a Hindu screaming angrily for no reason seemed strange. Now it’s election strategy. I lost 80% of my religion this year. And I think it’s because I started to believe in God. I believe that God exists in children, nature, animals. Pretty much anywhere but temples, churches and mosques. That’s where I believe God exists. Because that, like… ‘Cause I don’t think he goes to those places. I will explain why. Do you ever take a selfie, guys? You ever take a selfie? And you know how to make yourself look good in that selfie, right? But if you hand your friend the phone, they will fuck up the selfie. Absolutely. Why? Because they do not understand your correct angles. I think for God, man is that friend. We have always fucked up the image of God because we don’t understand his correct angles. Symbolically and visually. I think the first time Jesus Christ walked into a church, he was like, “What the fuck is that? Who drew that shit? You, Leonardo? Come here. What is that shit, bro? Who is that sad, skinny guy? What is this shit? What is that? I carried that cross for three days without carbs. You couldn’t draw a tricep, you son of a bitch?” Hindus, I think the first time our God Ganesha walked into a temple, he was like, “What the fuck is that? I’m half man, half elephant. That’s brown and gray. What is all this color? What, are you people on acid? What is this? Hinduism by Disney? What’s going on?” Muslims, I think the first time Muhammad walked into a mosque, he was like… I don’t know what Muhammad looks like, do you? Nobody does. Every time we try to draw the guy, somebody gets shot. Remember? I’m not doing that joke. Je suis intimidated, all right? I can feel your assholes just tightening up on that joke, yeah. Look, guys, I believe the future of world peace is not going to come from politics or economics. It will come from religions. The world will be okay when every religion in the world learns to have some fun and chill the fuck out. Can we agree on that, yeah? Two religions, in specific, Christianity and Islam. You’ve got to work your shit out, guys. I feel like, as Hindus, we can say that shit. ‘Cause Hindus are like your common best friend who’s caught in the middle of your awkward break-up.

And I think the only country in the world that can make that peace happen is you. America. You can do it. You can. You, America, just have to do with religion… what you have always historically done so well… with foreign food. Just, combine it and make your own stupid American version of it. Wouldn’t you like to see a religion of peace in the world? Would you like to see that, ladies and gentlemen? Yeah? Yeah? A new religion of peace when Muslims and Christians can come together and pray in harmony. Ladies and gentlemen, “Chrislam…” Breathe, breath, breath. Chrislam is a great religion, guys. You know how, Christians, you get Sunday? And, Muslims, you get Friday? So, in Chrislam, you get Saturday. You wake up on Saturday, you go to the “chosque.” And there’s great festivals in Chrislam, guys. There’s Eid-ster. Ahh! You just hide chocolate goats in the garden. So much fun. So much fun. There’s Shukriya-giving… …where you stuff a turkey into a burqa. And my favorite festival, guys – Halal-oween. Um… Halal-oween is so much fun. You know, where Christians and Muslims get together and dress up as the people who scare them. So, you know, Hindus. And then you have common praying in the chosque. It’s a beautiful thing, common praying. Our Father who art in Heaven… Our Father who… Allahu Akbar. Hallowed be thy name… Yalla be thy name. Give us this day our pitta bread. As we forgive those who hummus against us. Hallelu… yalla-a-a-ah! And then Sonu Nigam wakes up. Look, if we chill out and talk about religion, what is a religion? It’s a really old comic book. It’s a really old superhero story. Muslims, Allah is your Batman. Christians, Jesus is your Superman. Single-hero comic books. But, Hindus… we created The Avengers, motherfuckers. That’s our shit, right? Or did you think I wasn’t coming to you, huh? That’s all Hinduism is. It’s The Avengers. There’s too many guys. And nobody knows what the story is. And don’t eat beef. No matter what we say, we don’t understand any of it. We just end it with “don’t eat beef.” “Don’t eat beef” is our “Despacito.” We always come back to that shit in a circle. And we legit don’t eat beef. We are militant about that shit. We will eat a human being before we eat beef. In 100 years, India’s just gonna be, like, three leftover Hindus and 27 million cows. If you remove 80% of the bullshit in religion, it’s just a really cool story. That’s all that’s left. Like, Hinduism has some amazing stories. Who here has read The Ramayan? If you’ve read it, clap your hands, yeah? The rest of you, you have to read it. It’s one of the coolest stories in the world. So, tonight, because we are in San Francisco… with your permission… I would like to take America through The Ramayan. No, no, no! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Shut the fuck up! ‘Cause if you write a blog after this shit, I will go to jail. The law is very clear. If I distort facts about The Ramayan, I can go to jail. So I will not do that. The only thing you will hear coming out of my mouth is fact. And the rest of this is a silent bit. So, for the Americans, let’s recap the story of The Ramayan. Our lead God was a God by the name of Ram. His wife, our lead Goddess, was a lady by the name of Sita. Ram and Sita lived in the forest together for how many years? Fourteen! Fourteen years. For protection, they took along Ram’s brother Laxman. So it was Ram, Laxman and Sita in the forest together for 14 years. That’s a fact. Americans on board, yeah? Ram, Laxman, Sita in the forest together for 14 years. One day, in the middle of the night, Ram and Laxman were hunting a golden deer in the forest… with the great bow given to Ram by Lord Shiva. In the middle of the night, Sita got abducted by a demon named Ravan. Sita went missing. Ram got pissed. Shit got real. And that’s The Ramayan. Fact! Fun fact, did you know… that Laxman did not sleep for 14 years when they were in that forest? Did you know that shit? Yes, he stayed awake. Can you imagine how creepy that was for Sita? I’m just saying, you wake up in the middle of the night, there’s a dude like… “Hello! Good morning. You’re sleeping well?” “Ram, can you get your creepy brother out of here, please? You know what? Go to the forest and get me a deer. And make it golden because, you know, Delhi girl… “So, he left. Now… Pay attention, San Francisco. In the middle of the forest they saw a beautiful golden deer. Just… Ram was like, “Okay, sh… …I’m gonna shoot the deer.” “Good!” “Ram.” “What?” “Why don’t we…” “What?” “Shiva gave it to me, all right?” “Shoot the deer.” “I can see you.” “What is this?” “Shiva gave it to me.” Look, if you remove the bullshit from religion, if you lose 80% of your religion, what’s left over is a cool story. I love cool stories because of my grandfather. I called him Baba. He was the greatest storyteller I ever met. I lost him last year. Saddest day of my life. The next day, all we could do was sit around and tell stories about how he told cool stories. This beautiful mix of just grief and plagiarism, to be honest. And the best thing about his stories were that they had no relevance to the conversation you were trying to have. He just decided to say that shit. My first heartbreak, I was 16 years old. I ran to him. “Baba, Saba left me. What do I do?” He said, “You know, one day I tied your father to a tree and beat him. Then I got thirsty, went into the house, had some pani, came out, beat him some more.” Which is not the appropriate answer to my question or, when you think about it, is the appropriate answer to every question because at that moment, you’re not thinking about your breakup. You’re just thinking, “This dude’s a badass.” Who hydrates in the middle of child abuse? My granddad taught me that 80% of this honesty that we value so much in each other is unnecessary. If you can tell beautiful, truly beautiful lies, guys, the entire universe will conspire to make those lies a reality. I submit to you Harry Potter. Harry Potter is a lie made up by a lady in Scotland, but it’s a beautiful lie that children believed, they made it a reality. There are movies, merchandise, theme parks. If you go to King’s Cross Station in London, you will see a pillar that actually says “Platform…” 93/4 “…93/4.” It’s actually there and you can watch… as stupid children… run… 60 feet into bricks… and fall off stupider than when they came to the station. Awesome. Because they believe a beautiful lie.

Now, before I tell you my next story, are there any Sardars or Sikh gentlemen in the audience? I believe that 99.99999348% of Sardars are incredibly intelligent individuals. Cool? Now, if you apply that percentage to the total Sikh population of the world, that leaves three. And those three Sardars are in my next story. Now, when I was 12 years old… And you said we were cool, man. When I was 12 years old, my best friend Amandeep got appendicitis. It was very serious, his appendix ruptured, but that was not the beautiful lie he told me. He said, “Man, one day, my stomach was hurting. I told them, ate ice cream for two weeks and skipped my exams.” And I believed the beautiful lie, so I waited four months for my opportunity. In the middle of class, I raised my hand. “Excuse me, ma’am. My stomach is hurting. I believe I have ‘accendipitis’.” And my teacher was like, “I think that boy’s gay.” So, now I’m just in the hospital eating ice cream for two weeks. Every now and then, a doctor comes and pokes my stomach. I make a noise and the doctors believe the beautiful lie. And I am thinking, “More ice cream.” Except they are thinking, “Road trip.” So I get driven down to Chandigarh to Sector 37 to Santokh Singh Nursing Home. It is Friday night, three o’clock in the morning. There are two Sardar doctors with surgical masks looking down at me, of which one is Dr. Santokh. So clearly not a fancy hospital, more of a cottage industry, family business setup. Kind of scary. Imagine you boarded a Lufthansa flight and your pilot was Captain Thansa. They put a plastic cap on my face. I hear… “ssssssss” Which worries me. It’s not a Punjabi sound I’m familiar with. If the machine went, “prrrrrrrrrrrra,” I’m on board. They’re like, “Uh, Vir, could you count from one to 20?” Which I do, and the Sardars are suitably impressed. And… Fuck, man. All right, uh… And now all three of us are just awkwardly looking at each other because everybody in the hospital is still very much awake. So now the two Sardars have a conversation. “I, uh, think he’s still awake.” “Hainji? Really? What gave it away, huh? Was it the fact that his eyes are open and he’s looking at us right now?” “Fuck you, Bunty! Don’t give me attitude, all right?” Shhhhh! “Uh, Vir, could you sing the National Anthem?” So, naked… lying down on a bed, I go… …and pass out. Now, Indians, I know why you’re upset. I know what you are thinking. You are thinking, “He didn’t stand for the National Anthem.” Even Americans are like, “Could he take a knee?” “No, I couldn’t fucking take a knee.” I wake up 12 hours later. Dr. Santok is standing above me looking very pissed off because he has stopped believing the beautiful lie. And he says, “Vir, your stomach was not hurting, was it?” – “It is sore…” – “Shut up! We could get into so much trouble… if people found out that two Sardar doctors… could not tell a 12-year-old was lying to them. Because when we opened you up, we found a perfectly healthy appendix in there… so we removed it anyway.” And that’s the power of a beautiful lie. You can give yourself appendicitis.

What, you guys don’t believe me? Really? Who believes me? Raise your hands. Who doesn’t believe me? Raise your hands. I’m hurt, San Francisco. Legit hurt. Has anybody here had appendicitis? If you had appendicitis, raise your hands. Yeah, buddy, do you have a scar? How big is it? Is it about that big, yeah? Is it this big? Oh, shit just got real, huh, San Francisco, huh? That’s pretty big, right? That means when they were in there, they looked around and shit. There was a normal Punjabi surgery happening. You think the two Sardars had a conversation? “Uh, Bunty, do you see a perfectly healthy appendix?” “No, Santok, it looks kind of disheveled and it’s curving to the left.” “Bunty, that’s not his appendix.” So now I just lie and everybody around me is happier for it, I think. Look how happy you look right now. Maybe it’s because half the shit that I’ve told you tonight is a complete lie. Maybe, I never grew up in Africa. I never did a world tour. My granddad isn’t even dead. We flew him in for the Netflix special. “Baba, just stand up and take a bow, please.” Okay, my granddad actually is dead, but how much fun was that lie? That was fun. That was fun, guys. That was fun.

So I’m in therapy. I’m in therapy because I lost 80% of my mind. It’s very freeing. Now, see, Indians are so uncomfortable. We treat therapy like it’s an STD, right? Keep it down. Keep it quiet. Don’t tell anybody. But there might be a day in your life when you need to go to therapy, when you need help, and that’s okay. Maybe you have a loss. Maybe you have a heartbreak. Me, I did a movie called Mastizaade. Now, we’re gonna pause the show again, so I can explain to the American people what Mastizaade is. Look, Americans… Mastizaade was a really big budget sex comedy film… starring me. And the worst thing about Mastizaade, there’s no defense for how bad that movie was. Like, me trying to defend Mastizaade is like Hitler going, “Look, some of those Jews were assholes.” And the worst thing about Mastizaade is that it’s on Netflix. If you type “Vir Das” on Netflix, you will find Mastizaade next to this shit. But when I did Mastizaade, I did something that every Bollywood actor has done at some point in his career. I starred in a shitty movie. Fair? Fair? Did I know before I did it that it was a shitty movie? Yes! Fuck, yes, I knew it was a shitty movie. I read the script. It was, “Party, party, shit, shit, the end.” But I was kind of desperate. I needed the money and I got to romance Sunny Leone on screen for two months. Sunny Leone, one of the most beautiful women in the world, and you think… you think you are going to have cool stories to tell your children when they’re growing up. You tell them how you were Employee of the Month at KPMG or some shit like that. My kids are gonna be running up to me with iPads, “Papa, this lady?” “I love you, Papa. You’re my hero!” “Get in the Maruti.” She’s intelligent. She’s talented. She’s beautiful. She’s an entrepreneur. She’s down-to-earth, which is why when the movie came out, nobody got mad at her. Everybody got mad at… me. The Times of India is the largest circulated newspaper in the world. They had a supplement article with a headline that said, “Vir Das has committed career suicide. That’s if he had a career in the first place.” And then my phone stopped ringing… for five months. Fucking Vodafone wouldn’t call me. Once a month, that Airtel girl would put on a nun’s outfit, call me, and be like, “Shame, shame,” and put the phone down. And that’s what I felt. I felt intense, crippling shame, like I had messed up everything I had built for ten years. Eventually, all I did was really learn a lesson. Here’s the lesson I learned. I learned… …that your talent belongs to you… and weirdly, your reputation belongs to other people. Like, other people will decide when you are cool, uncool, finished, relevant, irrelevant, want a selfie, don’t care. It’s none of your business. Don’t think about that shit. It’s a disease. You can’t control it. Focus on the talent you have in front of you and you’ll always be okay. That’s what I learned. And I plan to take that suffering and that bleeding… and everything I went through… and put it all into Mastizaade 2, coming out in October, guys. It’s gonna be on Netflix. It’s gonna be fucking awesome. You know what I was trying to do with that movie? I was trying to get more famous really fast. That’s all it was. And I did. I got 20% more fame at the expense of 80% of my credibility. But we’re sold on these Bollywood dreams when we’re in school, right? We see Shahrukh Khan on TV. India’s biggest star spreading his arms and a girl runs towards him. And you’re like, “Man, I wanna do that some day.” And I did. I lived that dream. And when you do that shit, you discover that only Shahrukh Khan can pull that off. It’s terrifying. You need balls to pull that off. You know how actors have inner monologues? That’s what you tell yourself. “I have balls. I have balls. Big, big balls. Big, big balls.” Come, look at my balls. Don’t believe me? I’ll prove it to you now. Come on, everybody sing the song. “I have balls. I have balls. Big, big balls. Big, big balls.” And then you stay there… anticipating… longing… ’cause the girl is running towards you in slow motion. D-dshhhh. D-dshhhh. That’s the shit you see. I see… Ta-ta-tat-ta-ta-ta-ta! They shoot that shit in real time. Three seconds, she has arrived. You’re like, “Listen, I haven’t acted yet. Could you do another lap, please?” D-dshhhh. So, an Indian heroine spends her whole day just doing athletics. She’s got 90 kilos of embroidery and gold and jewels. You can see diamonds just flying off her as she’s running. You see the Queen of England behind her just picking that shit up. You see Nirav Modi behind that bitch picking shit up as well. When you live that dream… and 80% of that dream is over, all it does is give you more dreams. So now I don’t know if I want to be a Bollywood hero anymore. I want to be a superhero. I’m gonna just put this out there into the universe. I want to be an Indian superhero in a Marvel movie. #MakeVirMarvel All right, uh… It could happen, right? Did you see Black Panther? Did you see Black Panther? Oh, as somebody who grew up in Africa, it made me so happy to see… You know, it just made me happy to see African voices and African perspectives and African fashion, packaged together beautifully to make money for nine white people. It made me so happy, guys. Black people, God bless you. You just got Slumdogged. But my point is they still got their movie. They got Black Panther. Where is ours? Where is Brown Cow? Don’t you want to see Brown Cow, huh? You know, maybe 17 Avengers from now. It’s the end of the movie. Nothing is going well. All five Avengers are dead. Thanos is about to kill the world. The Earth is about to explode. All of a sudden, you hear… And a big cow comes and sits down in the center of the movie. And just like Indian traffic, the entire movie comes to a standstill around the cow. Thanos tries to kill the cow. 40 BJP supporters surround Thanos. “This is our Mother. This is our God. This is our Mother. This is our God. This is our Mother. This is our God. This is our Mother. This is our God.” – The Tesseract falls to the floor. – They’re like… “This is where the temple will be.” Because that is the defining political question of India for 30 years. “Build a temple or a mosque?” Fuck that! Make some parathas. Feed them to everyone.

I know it seems far-fetched, but I’m a man. You see this shit? This is all men. And men are defined by their unrealistic dreams. I’m a dreamer, San Francisco. Like, here’s a dream I have. I dream that… one day… monkeys will give scientists equal rights. For too long we have oppressed scientists… from their dream of becoming monkeys. Because in those beautiful five seconds when you fall asleep at night, when your dreams mesh into your reality… all a scientist dreams of being… …is a monkey. Do you feel me, San Francisco? No? Are you on board? No? And that’s how I feel about feminism. Okay, women, calm the fuck down. Jesus Christ! Did you feel the energy shift in the room, huh? Just the BuzzFeed articles rising in their bodies. Did you feel that shit? The dictionary defines feminism as the advocacy of equal rights based on the equality of the sexes. I’m on board with only the first half of that sentence. I believe we deserve equal rights. I do not believe in the equality of the sexes. I believe that women are beautiful, intelligent, layered, complex creatures. Men are with them. My definition of feminism is not letting a woman be whatever a man can be. It’s letting a woman be whatever a woman wants to be. To limit… To limit a woman to the achievements of a man is to ask a scientist to become a monkey. Feel better, ladies, yeah? You’re so stupid, you believe anything. All right, uh… No, whoa, whoa! Calm down. I identify as a feminist. If you do, clap your hands, please, yes? Isn’t it a wonderful feeling, guys, huh? Isn’t the best thing about it that you can identify as a feminist and feel like one without actually doing anything about it? You can just feel it… on the inside. That’s Indian feminism. We identify and fuck off. It’s feminism, not the Gymkhana Club. You don’t need a membership card.

If there’s one thing we can learn from racists, it’s less talk, more action. You don’t see racists identifying as racists, writing blogs about feeling the racism inside. No, they just wake up in the morning and they do racist shit every day, all day long, with commitment, and look how far their movement has come. They’re running your country, my country, Britain. Well done, racists. I say, “Well done, racists.” And, no, you know the best thing about racism? Anybody can be a racist. They let you in, irrespective of, like, your income group, your sexual preference, your nationality. Racism is a very inclusive movement, guys. With this whole feminism bit, ladies, I’m not trying to pander to you. I’m not trying to tell you what you need to hear because guess what? I’m a man. I don’t know, we haven’t shut the fuck up long enough to know what you want to hear, all right? All right? So, I’m gonna be honest. I don’t know how to be a feminist. I spoke to one and she said, “If you want to be a good feminist, forget how you treat women, begin with how you view yourself as a man because 80% of masculinity is bullshit.” And you think about that… Like, aren’t you tired of being a man? Can’t we just be male? Because being a man is fucking exhausting. And it affects the way you treat other people. Like, why do we have to show strength every day? Men have to show strength all the time in physical activities. Like you, buddy. Come here, shake my hand, please. If you can. Thank you so much. Why do I squeeze his hand so hard? Why are men expected to do this? Does this achieve anything? Yeah, what do I think? Toothpaste is going to come out of your ears? Is this powerful? No. You know what I like to do? I take a man’s hand and I kiss it. And then I watch as his life falls apart in front of me. As he quickly checks to see if there’s any movement in his underwear whatsoever.

Why do men have to defend women like they’re objects? I’m sorry. I don’t defend my wife anymore. If somebody insults my wife, I inform them that their insult could have been more accurate. Oh, you think she looks slutty now? You should have seen her in 2014. That was her thigh-high boots year. Speaking of which, why are men so obsessed with wardrobe? Not ours, yours. You think women care about what women wear? No, we care about what women wear. We look at your wardrobe like it’s the Rosetta Stone, just looking for hidden messages in that shit. Every time a woman in India wears something revealing, like many of you are doing tonight, Indian men say shit like, “Oh, she’s asking for it.” Am I wrong, ladies? Have you heard that in your lives, yeah? Our politicians have said that shit on the news. “She was asking for it.” Which is bullshit. The infinite beauty and fun of being a woman is if she’s asking for it? She can just ask for it. Because it is available, I promise you. She can just think of it and 20 “its” will line up outside her door. For a woman, the world is Amazon.in. You can ask for it, compare it, size of it, deliver it, Prime it, non-Prime it. Cash on delivery, whatever you like. That’s the beauty of being a woman. It’s so specific. You get to ask for it. It! Men, we just want to get some. But nobody’s looking for hidden messages in men’s clothing, are they? I could wear a T-shirt that said, “Fuck me in the ass.” I give you full permission to fuck me in the ass and nobody would do anything about that. They’d just be like, “Well, that’s a cool souvenir.” Yet, men have the freedom to wear whatever we want… within limits. You know, you can’t just drape two bed sheets around yourself and run an investment bank. But you can run Uttar Pradesh.

So, how do we get women the freedom to wear whatever women want to wear? I’m proposing humbly a two-week course in school where all children cross-dress. All boys wear girls’ clothing, every single item, all girls wear boys’ clothing, every single item, so that the right dots connect in your mind as an adult. So, the next time you Indian boys, you go out to a club and you see a beautiful girl walking towards you, just mini-skirt, cleavage, heels… …your first thought as an Indian male is, “Her feet must be tired, man. Five-inch. Her under-boob must be so sore with the wire all tight jammed in there.” Most guys aren’t laughing ’cause you don’t know there’s a wire in the under-boob. You just thought there was 300 bucks in there for a rainy day, right? That’s how Indian aunties go shopping like ninjas. Hatsa-hatsa-hatsa! They pay from this one and put the change in that one. It’s debit, credit. I don’t know, that’s just my opinion. Ladies, it’s more valuable than yours. I come from India. We don’t even want you to cultivate an opinion. We oppress the Indian girl child by keeping her out of school. Are you familiar with this problem, yeah? Man, I think every single school in India should adopt disco nightclub policy. Couple entry only. If you are enrolling a boy, somebody has to enroll a girl. There are problems with this strategy. India has 72 million uneducated Indian men left over if you do this. What do you do with these fuckers? I’m proposing a new armed force. Like America has the First Response, call these guys the Worst Response. So every time India is at war with a country, you send these Indian men in and tell them to just exist. “Go to that country and exist.” Within one month, they’ll be shitting on monuments, spitting in public, starting illegal businesses, immigration rackets. Just distracting the opponent, then the army goes in there and kicks ass. Before you send in the troops, you send in the choots, ladies and gentlemen. That’s my strategy. Mission accomplished. Mission… …accomplished. And that’s a question I have about men. When 99% of men are failures, why are we so obsessed with the idea of accomplishment? The idea of success? If a man got up on a stage and told people that in the last two years, he had lost his fame, his fortune, his patriotism, his nationality, his religion, his credibility, his masculinity and his mind, is he even a man? Or is he just 20% of one? I don’t know.

I’m just here for the beef. A human being needs nine to ten ounces of beef every 15 years to stay healthy. A fucking doctor told me that shit. We ain’t done yet, San Francisco. Do you want to know what my job was in 2002? Yeah! I was a dishwasher in Chicago. Now… No, no, no. Indians, don’t get sad and sentimental. Fuck you! The minute you mention any other profession apart from doctor, lawyer, or engineer, Indians are like, “See, he struggled. He struggled.” I did not struggle. This is not an inspirational story. Being a dishwasher in America is fantastic. You get head gear, mouth gear, rubber gloves, apron, brushes, detergents. We give less equipment to a surgeon… …at Santokh Singh Nursing Home. When you’re a dishwasher, you spend most of your day watching food leave the kitchen. The one thing I always loved to watch was a beautiful piece of beef, ten ounces. The filet mignon. I’m sorry, Indians, “filet migg-non”. And sometimes that piece of meat would come back unfinished, a few bites left, and it just… God, it bred this… …this darkness, this resentment inside of me. I said, “Look at these fucking Americans wasting their beef! How dare you? You know, one day I will go back to India and there I can eat all the beef I want.” But you have to understand. This was a $29 steak. To me back then, spending 29 bucks on beef represented everything in the world I didn’t have. You know, peace of mind, success, the ability to kill a god. And so as a treat for myself, I’d been saving up for that steak dinner, and I had the money, and just before I could eat it, the American government took my dream away. They didn’t ban beef. My visa expired. I had to leave. You’ll find out. Um… And like I said, I didn’t think about that beef for 15 years until last month. True story. Last month, I went back to my college, Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois. Uh, I was their commencement speaker. I got given an honorary doctorate. Um… I’m Dr. Das now. And you did well in your board exams. But much better than receiving my degree for saving lives… what felt a lot better was the meal I had after. Because after that, after 15 years, I walked into the Grand Lux Cafe on Michigan Avenue in Chicago where I washed dishes for two years and I ordered the filet mignon and I finished every bite of that steak. Kind of.

This is not an inspirational story. Keep your shit together. I’ve had maybe 300, 400 steaks in my life. Don’t tell the BJP. And that steak… was the most… average steak I have ever eaten in my life. It was a shitty steak. I don’t know what I thought would happen. That I’d take one bite and the lighting in the restaurant would change, and music would begin to play and all the waiters would start a slow clap and they’d come and put their forks and knives on my table like the faculty from A Beautiful Mind? And two children would stand up on chairs and salute me and be like, “My captain, beef captain?” But none of that shit happened. In reality, I just sat there and I did something that I haven’t had time to do in three years. I just… thought about shit. And I thought about how many Hindus this story is going to piss off. There’s gonna be some Tweets. Or maybe they don’t care as long as it’s not a brown cow. I thought… about how eating an average piece of beef still felt better than shooting an average movie. I thought about how this might be a story my grandfather Baba would tell. “Huh, we used to wait 15 years for one piece of beef.” And then I thought I should stop eating this because this is a shit steak. And my stomach will hurt for real soon. Then my waitress came over and I noticed her looking at my unfinished piece of beef. She said, “Are you all set?” “Yeah. I’m done.” “So you’re finished?” “No.” And then I did the most un-Indian thing I might have ever done. I tipped… …well. My check was $42. I left my waitress a $350 tip with a note… that said, “Look, I know where you are right now because I’ve been here too. But you won’t always be here, I promise you. Just know that.” Smiley face. Which is a pretty sweet thing to say. Can we agree on that, yeah? Like, that’s the lesson I learned. If you want to feel good again, stop constructing good things for yourself. Just say good shit to other people and you’ll feel amazing. And if you’re gonna say good shit to other people, make damn sure that you say it… out loud. Because if you write it down on a piece of paper… in block letters… “I know where you are right now… …because I’ve been here too. But you won’t always be here… I promise you. Just know that.” Smiley face. She probably ran into the kitchen like, “This Indian guy wants to fuck me for 350 bucks! What the hell do I do?” So I panic and I run out of this restaurant, and I see that the waitress is running after me. And she stops me and she’s like, “Wait, you left me a $350 tip.” And I tell her the two-minute version of what it just took me an hour to tell you guys. She’s like, “Wow, that’s a crazy story. I just thought you miscalculated the tip.” But it seemed unlikely because, you know, Indian people… you’re, like, so smart.” Good night.

virdas2,"[Vir Das] What you’re about to watch wasn’t supposed to happen. It’s completely unscripted. It was totally unplanned. It’s just… a moment in time. When the world shut down, we decided to do 30 shows for charity, just to raise money for COVID relief. And every night, I’d ask people the same question. What’s the first thing you’re gonna do, the first thing, when this world reopens? Welcome to lockdown day. I don’t know what day it is. That’s the thing about the entire world going through the same thing at the same time. I guess it’s special. All right. What’s up! What’s up, everyone? Hello! Good evening, and welcome to what promises to be the strangest stand-up comedy gig that you and I have both ever been a part of. If you’re not using earphones, what I ask is that you get as close to the device as you possibly can so that I can hear you laugh. Because if I cannot hear you laugh, then it’s just me in a room talking to myself, worried that I’m going to die. We’ll begin with India’s official unity mantra against the coronavirus. On the count of three, everybody here will say, “Go, corona, go, corona, go, corona, go.” All right. Three, two, one… Go!

[audience] Go, corona, go, corona, go, corona, go. I’m not sure how this is going to go. Zoom shows, the future of stand-up… or the prelude to the death. What’s the first thing you’re going to do once the lockdown ends?

Where’s the girlfriend?

Santacruz. You look very young. You look like you’ve just read Harry Potter.

[audience laughing]

Like you’ve just finished the last page of Deathly Hallows. How old are you? Seventeen. How long has it been since you saw the girlfriend? Two months. Two months! That’s like, way before the virus. I think she might’ve left you, buddy, like… Just saying.

That’s before the lockdown. -[audience laughing] She attended your show, er, two days ago on the 15th. So I got a recommendation from your girlfriend. That sounds wrong. No, no…

[audience laughing]

Comedically, f*ck you, you tharki people, all right? I do not interact with 17-year-old girls ever, on policy, under any circumstances.

[Sargam] Celebrate my birthday.

Sargam, where are you joining us from?

[Sargam] Chicago.

Chicago? Jesus! What time is it there, darling?

[Sargam] Oh, it’s morning time. It’s 9:34.

9:34… I mean, where the f*ck do you have to be, right?

So, that’s great.

[audience laughing]

Americans, you wake up really early. They get to work by 8 o’clock over there, right? That’s how they’re the most powerful country… Er… Were the most powerful country in the world. Er… Before… Before somebody ate a bat… [all laughing] …and crashed your economy. A bat f*cked your country. Your whole country from across the world. And you thought a butterfly had a big effect. [laughing] That’s the toughest thing about this virus. It’s like we don’t know who to blame. ‘Cause that’s like the hallmark of being Indian, is before you solve a problem, you blame it on somebody else. And this is new territory for us. This is the first thing we’ve experienced in the last 73 years that is not Pakistan’s fault.

[audience laughing]

We are not used to things not being Pakistan’s fault. Now, all our politicians are on TV in masks. It’s great. It’s great to see conservative Hindu leaders dressing up exactly like the Muslim women they oppress.

[audience laughing]

We’re allowed to meet one person from outside your family, out in a park, with two-meter distance.

[all laughing]

Who are you utilizing this rule for? Who’s that person you’re meeting? -That’s my girlfriend. -Your girlfriend? [all laughing] And when you… When you meet your girlfriend, your steady girlfriend, after six weeks… in a park… er… you intend to socially distance? I highly doubt that. That’s why I am not gonna meet her until the lockdown is over. Can you ima… Like, I’m just picturing two people who are desperate and horny, standing two meters away from each other. And his girlfriend just going, “Man, I wish your dick was bigger right now, I really do.” “That would be so much more useful.” Eat food from my favourite place. “Eat food.” Okay, great. So, Srushti Shah, er… You know, I’m glad you completed the sentence. You know what I mean? Where you were like, “Eat food,” and we all got worried about you. And then you were like, “No, from my favourite place.” We were like, “She’s privileged. It’s fine.” We all got it then. It is okay. Yo, what are you studying? Fashion design. Fashion design. Okay, cool. We’ll pretend that’s a course. No, I’m joking. I’m joking.

In Gandhinagar?

Yeah. Good. You know, Gandhiji was known for great fashion. Er…

[audience laughing]

He had that one outfit that was really popular, you know. And he designed it himself, and, you know, it’s… Okay. Did you hear that uncomfortable silence, Srushti? On the Zoom call. All right. Cool. Erm…

I love Asian food.

Okay. The place is called TG’s. That’s the first place I’m going for. You’re eating dal-sabzi and all at home?

Haan.

You know that’s Asian food.

[audience laughing]

Oriental food. I’m just putting it out there, like… Cool. You realize we’re not in Scotland right now. Technically, this is… [laughs] I may be in a place that the virus came from, normally. You live… You’re from Wuhan, really? No, no, no. Are you patient zero? You brought it over? Normally, I live and I work in China. I do think that it’s a lot worse than maybe what they’ve let on. No. I mean, China is just like, “No, that’s not a body, that’s a…” “He’s just sleeping,” right? That’s basically all China’s been doing. “We’ve absolutely no new cases.” [imitates gunshots]

[Upasna] Graduate.

Upasna, graduate in what? Architecture from Manipal University. Architecture from Manipal University, which is half real. Let’s be honest, all right.

[audience laughing]

The field of architecture is real, but Manipal University means, “Papa gave 20 lakhs in a suitcase to somebody.” That’s basically what that shit is, right? There are places in Gandhinagar where you can go. NIFT, Gandhinagar. NIFT, Gandhinagar, cool. There’s… Er… The National Institute of Fashion Technology, right?

That’s what NIFT is?

Yes. ‘Cause, you know, fashion is all about technology. Er…

[audience laughing]

You know, sometimes… [laughs] Sometimes, I’ll put on a T-shirt and I’ll be like, “My God, this is hi-tech.” You know… “This is just…” “Whoever designed this…” [chuckles] “You know, when I eat Asian food, it just slides right off.” “How did they make that happen with this T-shirt?” I think I made fun of the fashion girl a little too much. Like, no stylist is ever gonna work with me again. It’s okay. Isn’t it all just hazmat suits for the next f*ckin’ decade? “Asian food.” It’s… I had to, I’m sorry.

[man] Celebrate 420.

Oh, man. Don’t you have ganja?

[man] No, bro. So, every time I go to a college, people write in there, “Vir Das. ‘Babaji ki Booty.’ Do you wanna get high together, bro?” “You want to smoke a ‘J’ together, bro?” And I’m like, “No!” Can you imagine what would happen if you, a college kid, got high with me, a 40-year-old man? And you’re like… [inhales deeply] “Hey, Vir Das, do you feel like the moon landing was fake and they never told us about that shit?”

[audience laughing]

You know, and I’d be like, “I have acid reflux.” Like, you know… [laughs] It would just be such a sad day. Are you able to smoke in your house? Yeah. Late night, I sneak up to my terrace and do things when they’re sleeping. You realize they know, right? They’re in their bed, like… [sniffs] “That’s Manali.” That’s what’s happening in your house right now. What’s the first thing you’re going to do after the lockdown ends? Somebody yell it out.

[Tanay] Stay home.

Who the f*ck is that? What are you sitting on? Is that a video gamer’s chair? Is that what that is?


That’s a gamer’s chair, yeah.

That’s a gamer’s chair, yeah.

[audience laughing]

Just have some multivits, buddy, because… I mean… Gamer generation, you guys… You can’t survive a peanut allergy. I’m not confident of your abilities in a pandemic. I am sorry. If you had to go outside, where would you go, what was your thing?

Clubbing.

What’s your favourite club? It was Tryst, but then it shut down for renovation. Yeah, bro, I feel you. Tryst… [all laughing] Tryst. Tryst was lit AF. You know, like, just… You know, like, f*ckin’ Friday night. Have like a… A Rooh Afza shot and build a world and… Head out to Tryst.

[woman] I’m from Dubai, UAE.

You’re from UAE. That’s not really, yaar… That’s just…

[audience laughing]

That’s just India with cleaner and meaner people. If India loved architecture more and hated Indians more, that’s Dubai.

[audience laughing]

So lockdown has been extended, again. And it will probably be extended again. And again… And again, and again, and… What’s the first thing you guys are gonna do after the lockdown ends? Yell it out.

[man] I’ll have ice cream.

Is it not available where you are?

[audience laughing]

I think it’s not available anywhere. Because what we’re doing here, I don’t know if you guys are doing this… Like, the package comes and then we sanitize the package. Er, and then, we take the food and immediately put it in another container and microwave that shit for 30 seconds to nuke all the f*ckin’… So just do that with your ice cream. Have some soup, man. [laughs] I don’t know what else to…

[audience laughing]

Pranav, you’re in Karnataka. What do you do, buddy? Er, actually, I was supposed… I’m supposed to go to US for my studies. I am just waiting.

[woman] Oh… Pranav, I have bad news.

[Pranav chuckles]

[woman] Aw… Er… And… But you have the visa and everything, it’s all done? No, no. Only I have admission and I have the date.

[Pranav chuckles]

[women] Aw… I hope it happens, man. I really, really do.

Like, I’m f*ckin’…

Thanks. I’m rooting for you. Like, positive energy from me to you. It’s completely unrealistic, but still, from me to you.

Yes.

[audience laughing]

[Vir Das] I know what it is to have that feeling, you know, firsthand. That feeling of, er… “I wanna go to America. My life’s gonna change.” “Everything’s gonna be…” I hope this kid makes it there before this virus kills that feeling. ‘Cause that feeling is important. [chuckles] I was feeling sorry for myself before the show. This kid is going through that. He just wants ice cream. That’s what he wants. Ice cream. And I need to toughen the f*ck up and… keep doing this.

What’s your name?

Hillary.

Hillary?

[Hillary] Yeah, from Moscow.

Hillary from Moscow, really? Oh, so… Oh, wow… So you are Mr. Hillary Dsouza. Good to see you, sir. That’s right. That’s right. That was not the surname that I was expecting when I heard “Hillary.”

[all laughing]

I’m gonna be very honest, I thought of an unhappy wife. Er… Millennials, that’s a Hillary Clinton joke, never mind. We’ll get to it. It’s the news.

[indistinct chatter]

It’s fine. No, no, no… She didn’t win. She doesn’t deserve your laughter. [Hetika] Go attend my dance class. Non-virtual. Hetika. What’s up, Hetika? What kind of dance? Erm, so I’m learning bhangra currently. Yo, lady. You don’t have to learn bhangra.

I don’t think there’s bhangra classes. -[audience laughing] There are. A more formal way of it. But, yeah. What happens in bhangra class? Er, sastriyaakaal, welcome to… [laughs] [Hetika] That. Just that and– Welcome to bhangra class. There are two buttons on ceiling. Hit buttons.

I don’t know what the…

Absolutely. For some reason, Indians do bhangra to classic rock.

I don’t know if you’ve like–

Oh, God. That’s horrible. They’re like, “‘November Rain,’ bhenchod.” Like, you know… It’s just…

[audience laughing]

I love it when we make white people do bhangra, ’cause they’re so happy to be included, right? They’re just like… “I think they forgave us.”

[audience laughing]

[woman] Houston, Texas.

Houston, Texas. What time is it there? 8:30 in the morning. Jesus Christ! [laughs] You’re watching stand-up for breakfast? Are you f*ckin’ serious? I’ve never had a gig where somebody eats poha in the middle of the gig. That’d be f*ckin’ great. Did you see Donald Trump today? It was great. He said, “You can inject disinfectant into your body.” If you inject disinfectant into your body, you don’t have to worry about the coronavirus. You know what I’m saying? Or even cleaning your house anymore. You have other worries, like, you know… Flowers, food, the size of the coffin, you know. Other things that you need to… to think about, man. What a train wreck, your guy is. But I’m really sorry. But, I mean, at least you have, like, some 500 trillion dollars or whatever, right? At least, you know… At least Donald Trump’s plan is not…

[imitates Trump] “Er, I want everyone to go to the balcony at 8:00 p.m.” Like, at least that’s not the plan.

[all laughing]

Can you imagine if that was Donald Trump’s plan…


[imitates Trump] “Er, we have the best balconies and I want everybody to go to the balcony at 8:00 p.m. and light a candle.” “We have the best candles in America.” “God bless America, God bless American candles.” “Good night, we’re all gonna die.” Like if that was… [laughs] Er, what’s the first thing you’re gonna do once the lockdown ends? Somebody yell it out.

[Ashish] Haircut.

Ashish, you look all right, though. -Like, it’s…

[Ashish] No, like… If you look at my beard, it’s too much than what I have normally. So, yeah. Beard and hair. I mean, we’re all being polite right now, and ignoring the fact that you need somebody else to trim your beard. Which is…

[audience laughing]

Just the most privileged f*cking thing in the world. The thing is that I actually used to do that– “No, but Ramu does it so much better.”

[audience laughing]

“Ramu gets in there, where I don’t want to go.” Barber… When I go to the barber– Shut up. Don’t explain your privilege, own it. [audience laughing] It’s either been, like, close to two months or 16 years since the lockdown began and… We took a little bit of a break from doing the shows because I was going through… some stuff. And now we are back. People come and see a Vir Das show, they come to forget about their shit. They don’t come to see mine. So… put your shit away.

♪ Put your shit away… ♪

[woman] So, it’s 6:50 a.m. right now.

6:50 in the morning. You got up to see a comedy show with your boyfriend?

Oh, wow.

So, marriage maybe after this? [chuckles] Oh, my God. Okay, it’s too early for this. “It’s too early for this,” as in 6:50 in the morning or in life? What are we talking about exactly?

Is it like… What’s the problem? Is it…

I should go.

[in Hindi] “I haven’t graduated” or “I haven’t taken a dump”?

[in English] What is the actual problem?

[man] Go back to Canada.

Go back to Canada.

Aw…

[audience laughing]

Me and my girlfriend, she’s on the call here. We came here for our engagement ceremony. And are you guys at least together in India right now? No. She’s in Ahmedabad. I am in Baroda. You flew from Canada…

[audience laughing]

…to India, to symbolically and romantically be together. And the minute you conducted a ceremony that binds you together for life, you f*ckin’ separated…

[audience laughing]

… and went to different cities.

[man] To do the ceremony. I feel like you deserve this predicament. You’re just making bad choices in this relationship. I don’t think you understand the delicate interplay between romance and geography.

Er…

[audience laughing]

[Monika] Hug people. Monika, you’re gonna go out and hug people? I’m of the same opinion as you. I feel like, the second there’s… Forget a vaccine, I feel like, a cure, we are just gonna be touching the shit out of each other.

[all laughing]

In a non-creepy way. Creepy is such a relative thing. I am kidding.

[audience laughing]

I was thinking about that the other day. If we get back to offices with social distancing, that’s gonna be terrible for the “Me, Too” guys, right? Where everybody is like six feet away. Just a lonely M.J. Akbar in the office.

[audience laughing]

[imitates M.J. Akbar] “You’re sexy.” Like, I don’t know… So, you know, every time I do this piece to cams in my own… private reality show that nobody’s watching, I, er… I come off as a bit of a bitch. Despite myself, I’m looking forward to today’s show. One for you, Zoom. First thing you’re going to do once the lockdown ends and we’re all allowed outside. Yell it out. Ride my bike. I mean, go riding, as in riding. I never understand when guys are like, “Dude, I rode my motorcycle.” No, you didn’t. It’s not like you showed up and your Harley was just there running wild like… [huffs, snorts] And you’re like, “Whoa, Harley, whoa.”

[snorts]

[audience laughing] And then your Harley Davidson took off. You’re like… And you have to jump on to it. Did I tell you, I almost bought a Harley? Like, I almost… And then I realized, “Oh, f*ck, I’m actually not an alpha.” And I think the way that you know that is the way my hands went like that. You know, guys, I’m actually not an alpha. F*ck this virus. F*ck the bat.

[man] Play football. This isn’t one of those fantasy things where a lot of guys who can’t play football get into a room together– No, no, no. Play actual, physical football. What’s your position? What do you play? I play right-winger. You play right-winger? Cool. I’m a left-winger myself. Erm…

[audience laughing]

We have different goals. You know. I wanna score a goal, you know, get a penalty. You guys wanna build a statue that nobody wants.

[audience laughing]

[Erika] I can go out all day.

You can go out all day? One second. What’s up, Erika, where you from? I am from Costa Rica. You’re from Costa Rica? Is there any, erm… Are there COVID patients in Costa Rica? Are there cases or not? No, we can go out all day. It’s fine? Everything’s cool? Yes, everything’s okay. Under control. Okay, I know you’re alone in the room, but can you feel the resentment from everybody else?

[audience laughing]

I can feel it. International, guys. [all laughing] Yeah. Hey, other Indian comedians, do you have unemployed people from COVID-free countries as your families? I think not.

[Shreya] Go on a cruise. “Go on a cruise.” Who the f*ck said that? Shreya, you have no f*ckin’ understanding of how science works? Have you not read every news article ever… that has come out in the last… And where are you going in this cruise? I don’t know. Just to… “I just wanna be… I don’t know.” “I just wanna be stuck on a ship with some people and a virus. That’s my plan.”

[boy] Gonna turn 16 tomorrow.

You’re 15 years old?

Yes. Buddy, don’t take anything I said seriously, all right?


[audience laughing]

Like, don’t tell anyone you were at this show, all right?

Just…

It’s all confidential. Don’t worry.

Who bought the tickets?

I did, myself.

You have a debit card at 16?

Yes. Are you doing child porn on the side? What the f*ck is happening? -Why do you have–

No, not at all, sir. I’m not insinuating that you do child porn. Usually, you get recognized. Like somebody on the Zoom call be like, “Yeah, are you…

[audience laughing]

…Chintu69?” Er… Just a second. Just a second. Is somebody knocking on your door right now?

[man] Yes, yes, yes.

[all laughing]

Is that your mom, or your girlfriend? Who is that? It’s my mom, actually. I have to take care of my sister, so she’s calling me. Buddy, go do your thing. No, I’m not going to, actually. I’m talking to you. -How old is your sister? -She’s only five years old, actually. She’ll survive, five is enough.

[audience laughing]

That’s fine. You don’t need to feed them or educate them. She’ll be fine. F*cker, go take care of your sister. I’m not having, like, some, er… child malnutrition on my conscience, you know. I’ve got enough. I did Mastizaade. I feel guilty enough about my life.

[woman] From Spain.

From Spain? Good Lord, hello. Nice to see you. It looks like you’re looking up so you’re watching me on a television? Yes. Computer’s broken. All right, so then I’ll try and make this look like it should. “Hello. How are you?” Er…

[audience laughing]

Is that helping you at all? Or not. Are you scared, are you nervous? Like, you know… Or are you just happy to see the f*ck out of each other? It’s weird. It’s weird because, like, er, Spanish are very sociable people. So when you meet somebody, you just kiss. Well, on the cheek. -[audience laughing] -So, its… Social distance is… We have a town called Delhi. It’s the same way, but that’s not, you know… Not quite as consensual as you guys. Yeah, that’s what happens in Delhi. [kisses]

[in Hindi] F*ck off, motherf*cker.

[in English] Madam, I am being Spanish, okay? Spanish. Er, I’m in Ireland right now. I’m Indian, but I am, at the moment, I’m in Ireland. You know, I guessed you were Indian from the, “Charu…” [mumbling]

[audience laughing]

So you’re stuck in college?

Well, I wouldn’t call it “stuck.”

Okay. Because we’re still, like, free to go outside on walks, like… Grocery shopping, and we can go out cycling and stuff like that. So I wouldn’t say, like, I’m stuck. All the other Indians are sitting there like…

[in Hindi] “Motherf*cker. You f*ckin’…”

[in English] She’s in a Spanish village, f*ckin’ drinking Prosecco. This chick is chilling and going out on her bicycle. Er, I’m doing master’s in Biomedical Engineering. Do you believe that? You believe we are headed for a vaccine September, October types? I highly doubt that, just because the whole process of actually getting a vaccine is so long. You have to, like, sleep with a Poonawalla, you know, it’s tough, er…

[audience laughing]

Let me tell you, that’s an inside joke. All right, cool. Just me? All right. Today is our first show for London. Er… Yay. Lond, Lond, Lond, Lond, Lond… I’m never gonna get to go to London again.

[woman] Go to the pub.

Go to the pub? Okay. And what’s your pub drink? What’s the first thing… What do you start the night with? Of course, a martini. A martini. Why is that “of course, a martini”? Maybe you want a beer. Like, I don’t know, if like… I’m not from, er, London. I don’t know why I got Indian when I said that shit.

[in Indian accent] I’m not from London, son. No pubs for you. And give Kohinoor back.

[audience laughing]

Just got married in India on March 13th, the day the world went to shit. And we… Our marriage… Nice. So you’re having like a f*ckin’ pandemic honeymoon. This is great.

[audience laughing]

Is your kid gonna be… Your kid has gotta be called Corona. That’s just gotta be a thing that happens. Okay, it is, er… 7:00 a.m. on a Sunday and… I’m about to do stand-up comedy for people in New York. This is so f*ckin’ weird.

[man] Get a haircut.

Get a haircut. There’s a sardar on the… Jaswin, I hope that’s not you. That wasn’t you. All right, cool.

[all laughing]

Jaswin’s just sitting there like, “When the lockdown is done, I’m done with this Sikhism, I gotta say.”

[audience laughing]

[Asmita] Get my eyebrows done. Get your eyebrows done.

[audience laughing]

Same, girl. Need it. Okay, admin, mute her. I thought this would be good. But f*ck this, this is just a… Okay. No, let’s talk about this. Can you not do it yourself? Like, is that not a… Tweezing eyebrows is serious business. You don’t mess around with that. Why? What’s the worst case scenario? You’d just look surprised by life.

[audience laughing]

You’re just like… Your friends are like, “Wow, Asmita really enjoyed that Starbucks.” “You know what I mean?” “I’ve been to Starbucks with her every day for a decade, but she really got into it today, I gotta say.” In India, people are like…

[in Hindi] “I’m not getting any food…” “Workers are migrating, this and that.”

[in English] Here it’s like, “I can’t get my eyebrows done, and I can’t drive my car.” You f*ckin’ privileged motherf*ckers.

[woman] No, it was a hospital birth. Erm, but it was just really odd. We didn’t have… Like, a nurse wouldn’t come to touch me or anything. So I just had to pretty much have the baby alone. That’s insane. So like, for the first time in history, the dad and the nurse have swapped. -‘Cause now the dad is doing all the work. -[audience laughing] And the nurse is just eight feet away like, “You’re doing great.”


[audience laughing]

The baby comes out, looks at the dad, and the baby’s like… “Is he the doctor? Why is he crying?” I heard a pretty good story about the virus today.

[man 1] Bat ate a fruit. Dropped the fruit. A pig ate it.

[audience laughing]

The pig got, whatever, cut, slaughtered.

Mmm-hmm. Went to that Wuhan wet market or whatever. Okay. Somebody bought the pig. The chef took it to a hotel. Okay. Somebody called him to say, “Compliments to the chef,” so he just wiped his hands, went and shook hands with him. Okay, so I just wanna say, if this is true, then you are a man of average intelligence and good information.

[audience laughing]

But if you’re f*ckin’ with me, then you’re a pure genius. I just love the confidence. [imitates man 1] “Bat. Ate the pig. Then the pig…”

[man 2] I’m from India, stuck in Singapore.

Plan was to call my wife here.

Okay. But suddenly this pandemic thing, stupid thing came in. All right, cool. I know, the virus is very stupid. We’re the smart ones.

[audience laughing]

It is day 9,562, and the virus continues to endure. It is like Rocky, part 19.

[flushing]

Like, I promise you… Is somebody in the toilet? I just heard a flush.

Did you guys f*ckin’ hear that shit?

[audience laughing]

You f*ckin’ hear that shit? [woman 1] Someone’s in the toilet. Someone is taking a dump during my show and it’s not me.

[woman 2] This is epic. This is epic.

♪ Me, ma, me, ma, me, ma, me ♪

I’m in Madrid right now. I, er, dance flamenco here in Spain. Ooh, nice. So I’m just waiting to put on the flamenco shoes. I think you can do flamenco dancing socially distanced. Because flamenco’s like a girl who does that stuff and does the tap, tap, tap, with her feet. And then two meters away is just a guy with a guitar looking at her hornily, right? That’s basically flamenco. That’s what that is. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. He’s like… [imitates guitar strumming] That’s it, that’s the dance. Yeah, lot of sexual tension. He’s like… [imitates guitar strumming] She’s like… [taps feet] “Stay away.” He’s like, “But I love you…” [imitates guitar strumming] “I can see it in your eyes that you want me.” She’s like, “I will hide my eyes, then.” Tsk. So, two nights ago, er… We begin with funny man Vir Das, whose neighbour threatened to cough on him. Probably the craziest night I’ve ever had in Mumbai. Er… The older gentleman sneezed on me. Er, and we’re okay. You know, we… We sorted it out. We’re friends now. But I’m just gonna tell you the story. [clicks tongue] Sneezing on someone is such a f*ckin’ intimate act, you know? It requires, like, consent and proximity, neither one of which I gave.

[audience laughing]

I wanted to… He was like, “You’ll be haunted,” and I didn’t respond to that. ‘Cause I’m very scared of ghosts. I’ve had, like, a ghost experience in my life. Like, it was in college where, er… [chuckles] I was… I was lying on my bed and I felt somebody sit down on the bed. There was nobody else on the bed. And I knew there was a ghost in the room. And then in my ear, I heard somebody go, [hoarse whisper] “Do you have any ganja?”

[audience laughing]

And I was like, “What?” And the ghost was like, “Yeah, bro, you have any stash?” “There’s no stash in heaven.” And I was like, “Why is there no stash in heaven?” And he was like, “Think about it, bro. Plants can’t grow on clouds.”

[audience laughing]

And I never thought about that before. Plants can’t grow on clouds. Do you know what that means? There are no vegetarians in heaven.

[audience laughing]

I think that’s why they call it heaven. Er…

[audience laughing]

And I called my lawyer in the middle of the night and she’s like, “This happened. Put it up.” And now, every single news outlet and Twitter outlet, and we’re on the f*ckin’ TV, is carrying this. And I’m positioning like I have a sense of humour about it, right? I have to get a f*ckin’ COVID test now. He pulled down his mask and he was like… He was like… Achew! Like, that’s what happened. [audience laughing] It was really sweet. Like that was the sneeze. He was like… Achew! I feel like what happened was, in his mind, he was like, “I’m gonna sneeze on him,” and his body was like, “No, you’re gonna cough on him.”

[audience laughing]

And then it just got combined. Your body will do that sometimes. You’re like, “I’m gonna laugh,” and your body is like, “No, you’re gonna fart and shit your pants a little bit.”

[audience laughing]

And I’m a comic. I know my job. I’m a comic. I will take this shit and I will write jokes about it. Everybody said, “Why didn’t you hit the man?” And the only thing I can think of is somewhere in my mind and in my body, I was like, “Don’t do this. I have a future.” I can’t get cancelled right now. I have a future. How do I even talk to a therapist about this? They’d be like… “Yeah, I’m just gonna refund this session because… they did not teach me this at the University of… Bughtown.” Bughtown? It’s such a pain in the ass to be 40 years old and now find out that you’re a f*ckin’ optimist.

[audience laughing]

You know, it’s like finding out you’re diabetic, you know what I mean, it’s like… “Oh, I have to change my whole life now, man. F*ck!” “I have to give up stuff that I like, sugar and self-pity.”

[woman] No, no, but I’m American. An American who is in Delhi, so I’m from outside of the country. Nice! Yeah, so how long have you been a refugee?

[woman] Almost three years now.

Almost three years. And what’s your line of work?

[woman] It’s, erm, an adjustment. I’m not okay with the locusts coming our way. I’m not okay with that. I can survive the heat, I can survive the dust storms, I can survive the politics, but I draw the line at biblical plagues. Okay, cool. Like every American, that was not the answer to my question, and too much information.

[audience laughing]

I had asked you what your line of work was. What do you do for a living?

[woman] I am a travel agent. We actually got 4,000 American citizens out. We arranged flights for each one of them. Well done! Give her a round of applause. That’s well done to you. That’s great, you know? [all clapping] You know, just taking them out of India, where there are very few cases, and sending them to America.

[audience laughing]

[laughs] Good for you. Taking them from India where hydroxychloroquine costs 20 rupees, to America… where the medical insurance system is not flawed at all to charge you 3,000% of what the medicine actually costs.

[woman] But I chose to stay.

[man] Paris.

[Vir Das] You’re in Paris? How is the situation in Paris? It’s opening up, right? There are no tourists and everywhere is free, so it’s a lot of fun. Don’t act like a f*ckin’ French person and be all egocentric about this shit. That you have a… To say shit like that, you have to have a French accent.

[in French accent] “It is lovely, there are no tourists, I can smoke and…” “I can have this existential misery that is so typically French.”


[in normal voice] Like, that’s… But you’re like, “No, there are no tourists, we’re liking it very much, Paris is beautiful.” Like, it’s that… You’re too friendly to pull off French smugness, I’m sorry.

[woman 1] I’m from Melbourne. Kind of confused as to what I want to do. Okay. I’m moving on. I can’t hear you. I’m sorry. We don’t have this kind of time. A, these tickets don’t cost enough for me to get into therapy with people and shit. This is 4.99 for charity.

[woman 2] We’re from Lagos.

[Vir Das] You’re in Nigeria right now? What time is it right now in Africa? Those are two thumbs up, but can you tell the time? [chuckles]

[all laughing]

[woman 3] I’m an anthropologist. All three of us are. F*ckin’ hell! That is, like, the weirdest threesome I’ve ever seen. No. It’s just a strange… I’m just saying… that if the guy on the left developed an alcohol problem, he’d become the guy on the right. You know what I mean, it’s… Maybe I should just do the show like this, haan? Hey, guys. Er… Lockdown’s going really well. [laughs] [inhales] I will clean myself up. I am gonna make some people laugh.

[Sharique] Sheesha.

[Vir Das] Sheesha is not available to you? I’m staying with a kid, four months old. I cannot bring that home. And your kid does not like doing sheesha?

[audience laughing]

Sheesha…

[Sharique] Definitely not. Sheesha is not a good substitute for a mother’s teat? [laughing]

[Sharique] Definitely not. Listen, beta, we’ve got… [laughs] Listen, beta, we’ve got no lactose, but try this apple. [inhales deeply] Cough freely without being conscious that somebody’s gonna judge you. I work for an airline. It’s a good place to be coughing.

[all laughing]

Are you cabin crew, or do you work in, like, the offices?

Er, the office. -All right, great. Working from home. Nice. Because you just don’t want cabin crew like… [coughing] “Veg or non-veg,” coming down the aisle.

[audience laughing]

[woman] I’ve come from China. I need to go back. So the first thing I need to do is go to the airport, take a flight and go back home. Okay. And when did the mental problem start?

[audience laughing]

You’re trying to get back into China? They shut borders to the world, like… Wow, that’s like all of their history.

[audience laughing]

Today is, er… hmm, a bit of a crazy day. I, er… I got featured in a magazine called Q. Much of my idols were on there. Like Seinfeld, Ellen DeGeneres and Letterman and Chappelle and Chris Rock, etc. I had like a small feature. And… I was reading the bigger features and I saw Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock talking to each other in a café. And they… talked about me. As in, I came up. It wasn’t like they got together… [chuckles]

[imitates Chris Rock] “Jerry, we got to talk about Vir.” No. No, that’s… They’re talking about many things and I happen to come up. Jerry Seinfeld told Chris Rock, erm, “I saw this Indian guy, Vir Das.” “Saw some of his stuff. He’s a really funny guy.” Across the world. I’m sitting in… a 100 square-foot room in Bandra. And… in a café in New York… Jerry Seinfeld is telling Chris Rock… that I’m funny. Vir actually turns, er, 36… erm, on Sunday.

No, f*ck off, Kavi. -I wanted to sing “Happy Birthday” to him.

No, don’t do this shit. Please don’t do this shit. It’s embarrassing. One, two, three.

[all singing] ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

It’s my birthday tomorrow. [indistinct singing] In this moment… I feel eight years old. Isha Paliwal, is this your lovely baby in the frame? No, I’m her aunt. Okay, great. That’s somebody else’s baby that you have put on camera without their consent.

[all laughing]

She’s just your youngest fan.

[woman] Aw… I… How am I supposed to communicate with the baby? What do you think is gonna happen right now? Oh, well, she can reply, “Hmm, hmm, hmm…” Great, er…

[audience laughing]

Hello, baby. Thank you, baby, for watching this Zoom call. And I apologize, baby, for the pandemic that is out there even though you don’t f*ckin’ know what a pandemic is.

[audience laughing]

It’s not working, Isha. I tried, all right? F*ckin’ hell. This… Like, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. No, no. I’m very sorry. Like, I’m really good on feedback and trying to improve my craft, but this f*ckin’ baby is a bad audience member. All right. That’s what I’m gonna say. This baby is a terrible audience member and does not belong at a stand-up comedy show.

[Yuvan] London.

You’re in London right now? This is your lovely friend, or… This is my lovely friend. Her name’s Emily.

Emily, you guys are seeing each other?

Absolutely. Great, and, er, marriage on the cards? Oh, gosh, no.

Oh…

[all laughing]

I’ve never had a breakup on Zoom before. I think this might be my first, guys. This is great. “Oh, f*ck, no.” He couldn’t control it, you know? Emily, you like this Indian man, yeah? Well, not right now, no.

[all laughing]

Oh, Yuvan, enjoy the other bedroom and/or sofa tonight. So every time I do a show, er, when you open the door, I’m gonna show you what happens. Er… First thing when you open the door. You ready? Hang on. Let me put this viewfinder… This is the door to my study. Every time you open that door… what you see… [chuckles] is the one audience member who has watched… many, many shows. Which one of you is Smarnika, because if…

This one.

I said that. Because if the three of you are Smarnika, then it’s like one of those OSHO ashram things, you know what I mean? Like you are… “All women are Smarnika.”

[all laughing]

“You must find your inner Smarnika.” “Release your Smarnika.” Oh.

[audience laughing]

It’s so strange that, you know, the western sexual revolution throughout history has been driven by Indian men who, back home, nobody wanted to f*ck in the first place.

[woman] I’m in Bombay.

You’re in Bombay. I wanna have Thai food so I’ll go to Nara Thai. Like, they fry the betel leaf and then there’s this chutney type thing that comes along which is amazing. [laughs] What the… Okay, I’m not gonna pretend to know. What the f*ck is a betel leaf?


[man] Paan ka patta.

[in Hindi] You should’ve said that. “Woman from Thane.”

[all laughing]

[in English] “I’ll have a betel leaf.” [laughs]

[all laughing]

Paan patta. Paan.

[audience laughing]

[in Hindi] Say, “Paan,” not betel leaf.

[in English] I love it, man. I feel… Betel leaf sounds like a safe word during sex, you know what I mean?

[audience laughing]

You know, couples have safe words, you know? I feel like, she sticks a finger up your ass, you’ll be like, “Betel leaf, betel leaf.”

[audience laughing]

And when she doesn’t get it, you’re like, “Paan ka patta, paan ka patta. Pull it out.”

[audience laughing]

Last show. I am, er… leaving tomorrow.

[man] Live the same way.

Er, Malhar Broker? -Yeah. -Okay, is your last name “Broker”? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. [laughs]

Are you a broker? Er, no. No, of course, yeah, why would you be? That’s, yeah… Cool. No, my last name is Das and I’m not a servant. It’s okay.

[audience laughing]

All right. Malhar, what do you do? I’m a baker now.

[Vir Das laughing]

You’re called Broker Baker? Broker…

[audience laughing]

[Malhar] Nice name. Broker Baker. You’re just gonna go out and bake more bread for the city of…

Mumbai?

Ahmedabad. Of Ahmedabad? You’re… You’re in a bakery in Gujarat? Yeah.

[audience laughing]

I don’t think I have to say it. But I think you know what I’m thinking of. [all laughing] I’m just gonna move on really, really quickly.

[man] I don’t know how to go to settings, to get out of privacy thing.

[all laughing]

Er, so, Uncle, what you do is, you go to the top right. I can’t believe… Ishaan, why do I have to explain technology to your f*ckin’ parents, dude? [audience laughing] Dad, it’s on the top right. “Dad, it’s on the top right.”

[man] Son, I did that. I just switched in the start window. Ishaan, he did that shit.

[all laughing]

[man] This sounds complex. It’s very complex. Ishaan, you should’ve trained your parents better. -I’m just saying, all right? -I know, I know.

[Vir Das] What did your mom want?

[Aneyant] She wanted to watch it, too. Of course she’s welcome to watch it, don’t be silly. If she wants to sit down and… yeah. Er… Why am I trying to peek like I can see through your…

[all laughing]

Hi, Aunty. Why am I bending again? Good evening. Your son is learning a lot in this show. Er… Aunty, do you know about the girlfriend? Yeah, I… I have some, erm… You know.

[all laughing]

This is gonna be a silent f*ckin’ dinner at home, right? “You embarrassed the shit outta me, Mom. In front of that old-ass comedian.”

[audience laughing]

He’s a sweet kid. He was. [Vir Das] Cole. Nicole, er… Shiflet? Hey, I’m a healthcare worker. You’re a healthcare worker? Round of applause, immediately. Let’s do it, come on, guys. Well done. So is Dr. Sujay Jaju with us this evening?

Yes.

Are you here, sir? You know, I say that in public all the time, just to get a round of applause. That’s what I do. You’re isolated in Mumbai and you’re watching my show as you’re isolated in Mumbai.

[Sujay] Yes, I am. Er, and so, this is your day off?

It is. I’m a night shifter.

You’re a night shifter. I work in the emergency department. I’m a paramedic. How are you feeling? I’ll begin by asking, how’s your health? Er, it’s improving each day. Like, I had a bit of fever and also stuff… COVID-related complex… But I am doing great. Yeah. You’re a paramedic in the ER? God, so you’ve had a long, I imagine, three months, right? -Yeah. For sure.

And I imagine you’ve seen some stuff. Do you know how you got it? Where you got it?

[Sujay] Er, actually, I was posted in COVID duty. I was posted in medicine merge for over a month. So, I might have contracted, er, the infection over there. But I know that I’ll come back stronger. Sir, I promise you two things, all right? Well, tonight’s show is entirely dedicated to you. You have my word as an artist that I will make sure it reaches the maximum amount of people that I can make it reach. It is your day off and I’m gonna give every ounce of my being to make sure that you have a good day today. Yeah, it’s definitely not as scary as we think. Actually, it’s been made a lot, er, scarier by the people.

We all know the basics of this thing.


[Sujay] Yeah. Wash your hands, don’t touch your face, touch your balls.

Exactly.

We all know the…

[audience laughing]

Obviously.

[audience laughing]

You’re in isolation. You understand as well, Doctor.

[Sujay] Yeah. Thank you for everything you’re doing. Don’t be silly. Look, the entire show is in Hindi. Erm…

[audience laughing]

I, erm… Erm… Twelve years now, and it takes a lot to surprise me in this profession. We started doing these shows because we had to. For charity. And it was important and… I was a little bit cranky about it because I was like, “I don’t know if this’ll work.” For the first time, I’m looking into my audience’s houses. That’s a very weird thing to happen as an artist, you know, where the soundtrack to my life has been laughter. Every evening, I hear laughter. And I never thought that I would hear this much laughter in a lockdown. For the first time, I can see you, and your life. As opposed to you just coming and seeing me. From… everywhere in the world. So I… I thank you. Because, erm… So it’s really strange. I’ve been performing for you over a decade, but it’s like we’ve just met. You know, this show is for charity and we’ve raised money, and I hope you’ve had a good time as well, but… it is deeply… meaningful to me, to be able to practice my art form in this. You know, it’s not when there’s a cure, it’s when… It’s when you no longer fear death, I, as an artist, get to live again. And that’s very ironic. To wait on that. And not drown. Or get rusty. And the fact that we have a healthcare worker today, I… I don’t think that this could be more perfect to wrap it up, because… This is my last show. Erm… It’s true. ‘Cause we leave Bombay tomorrow. I should… I should show you the room. Why the f*ck not? This is where I’ve lived for the last few… That’s the desk. Erm… It’s kind of a wall with all my posters. That’s my books and my hats. And tomorrow… I hope the universe pays you and every healthcare worker tenfold, ten thousand fold. And thank you for everything that you do. And thank you so much for watching the show tonight, guys. I hope you had a good time.

[soft guitar music playing]
